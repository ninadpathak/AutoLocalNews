> **TLDR**: RCB had a clean sweep in the Navi Mumbai leg of WPL 2026. Looks like Smriti Mandhana's squad came to win, not just participate.

Is it just us, or is the Women's Premier League actually exciting this year? RCB, written off before a single ball was bowled, just wrapped up a perfect run at the DY Patil Stadium.

Smriti Mandhana’s side didn't just win; they steamrolled the competition. Forget nail-biters; these were proper, convincing victories. The kind that makes other teams nervous when they see the RCB logo on the schedule.

So, are they the team to beat in WPL 2026? Maybe. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. But for now, residents near the stadium can sleep soundly knowing their team gave them something to cheer about. And that's worth more than any trophy... almost.
