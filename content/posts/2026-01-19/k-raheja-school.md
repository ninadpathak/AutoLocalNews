> **TLDR**: K Raheja Corp is building a school in Navi Mumbai. Finally, some good news that isn't about another delayed infrastructure project.

K Raheja Corp is adding a school to its property portfolio in Navi Mumbai. No specific location was given, because *obviously*. 

Details are scarce, but the real estate giant is expanding into education, apparently. Will it be another fancy international school charging lakhs? Place your bets now. My money's on "yes."

What Navi Mumbai *really* needs is affordable, quality education. Another bougie school catering to the SoBo expats feels…tone-deaf. Maybe they'll surprise us. Maybe pigs will fly past the Vashi bridge. One can dream.

Still, a school is a school. More options are generally good, right? Let's just hope it's not another mirrored glass monstrosity that looks like it belongs in Gurgaon, not here.

We'll keep you updated as soon as we have actual, you know, *information* about the project. Until then, speculate wildly in the comments.
