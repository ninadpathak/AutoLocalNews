> **TLDR**: A 43-year-old tailor in Vashi got arrested for sexually assaulting a minor. What is wrong with people?

The cops picked up a tailor from Sector 17, Vashi, yesterday, following allegations of sexual assault on a minor girl. The Times of India reported the arrest but didn't name the accused.

The victim's family filed the FIR at the Vashi police station. Details are sketchy, but the charges are serious. The accused is cooling his heels in the lockup while the investigation cranks up.

This isn't the kind of 'bespoke tailoring' Vashi residents were hoping for. The incident has sparked outrage amongst residents, especially near the Sai Baba temple. If convicted, the tailor faces a long stretch behind bars. This is Navi Mumbai; justice needs to be served. Fast.
