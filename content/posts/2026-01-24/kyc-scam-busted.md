> **TLDR**: Cops busted a KYC scam ring operating out of Jharkhand and West Bengal. They stole ₹2 crore...the nerve of these guys!

Navi Mumbai's cybercrime unit just took down a gang of digital bandits. Turns out, those KYC update requests weren't so innocent after all.

Four people are cooling their heels in jail right now, thanks to the Nerul police. They allegedly ran a nationwide KYC scam, tricking people into handing over their bank details. The scam stretched from the backwaters of Jharkhand to the mean streets of West Bengal, allegedly siphoning off ₹2 Crore in the process. That's enough to buy a few *decent* flats in Seawoods.

Their method was simple: call people pretending to be bank officials, scare them about their KYC, and then drain their accounts. Sector 17 Vashi resident, Mr. Sharma, lost ₹5 Lakh to these fraudsters. This is a stark reminder: don't give your OTP to *anyone*.

Police are still digging into the extent of the operation. More arrests are expected. The investigation is focused on recovering the ₹2 Crore before the alleged scammers blow it all on crypto and questionable real estate deals.
