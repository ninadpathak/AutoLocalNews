> **TLDR**: Government gifted prime land near Navi Mumbai Airport to TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams) for peanuts. Is this development or daylight robbery?

So, *this* is how it's done. The state cabinet just gifted prime real estate near the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) for a cool ₹1 per square meter. Yes, you read that right. 

The plot, a juicy 20,000 square meters in Ulwe node, Sector 12, is practically free. TTD plans to build a grand temple, information center, and lodging for pilgrims. All sounds noble, but eyebrows are raised higher than the under-construction Adani Realty towers nearby.

Consider this: Similar plots in the area are fetching ₹80,000-₹1,20,000 per square meter. Did someone forget a few zeros? NMMC officials were unavailable for comment (surprise!). 

While devotees rejoice at the prospect of easier access to Tirupati darshan, Navi Mumbaikars are left wondering who exactly is benefiting from this 'divine' deal. Another sweet deal for a religious org or did someone forget to adjust the decimal point?
