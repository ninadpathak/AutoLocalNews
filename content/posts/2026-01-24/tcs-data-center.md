> **TLDR**: TCS wants to build a huge 120 MW data center in Navi Mumbai with AWS and OpenAI. Finally, something cool is coming to Navi Mumbai that isn't just another apartment building.

TCS is reportedly planning a massive 120 MW data center in our backyard. They're looking to partner with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and OpenAI. Think of the possibilities!

The project is expected to boost TCS's cloud computing and AI capabilities. The location hasn't been pinpointed, but sources say it will be somewhere in Navi Mumbai. Maybe near Ghansoli? Somewhere with power, that's for sure.

This isn't just about servers and cables. This is about bringing serious tech infrastructure to our city. Imagine the jobs! Imagine the bragging rights! This is way better than another mall.

So, while Mumbai drowns, Navi Mumbai gets smarter. Just saying.
