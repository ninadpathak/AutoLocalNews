> **TLDR**: The High Court is big mad about Navi Mumbai and Mumbai's air pollution. If things don't improve, top officials might not get paid. 

The Bombay High Court is playing hardball. They're threatening to withhold the salaries of top dogs in both Mumbai and Navi Mumbai over the never-ending air pollution saga. Someone finally had enough of breathing fumes.

The court's order came down on [DATE - *insert date of order from source article if available, else omit*] during a hearing about the worsening air quality. Specifically, the judges called out the commissioners of both the NMMC and the BMC, noting their apparent lack of urgency in tackling the issue. The court wants IMMEDIATE action, not more excuses. 

What's at stake? Potentially the November salaries of these officials. The High Court basically said: clean up the air, or clean out your bank account. They want a detailed action plan presented ASAP. Think of it as a very public performance review.

 Meanwhile, residents choke on Sector 15's dust. The Nerul flyover construction throws up clouds of construction dust. All while officials debate the definition of "clean air".
