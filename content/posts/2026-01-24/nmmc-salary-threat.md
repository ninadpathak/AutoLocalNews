> **TLDR**: The Bombay High Court is tired of waiting and warned they'll stop the NMMC Commissioner's paycheck. Finally, someone's holding them accountable for something around here.

The Bombay High Court is not messing around. Fed up with delays, justices issued a warning: the Navi Mumbai Municipal Commissioner's salary is on the chopping block. It's about time.

Specifics on *why* the court is fuming are still emerging, but it's related to pending actions the NMMC was supposed to complete. Remember that overflowing nullah near Sector 17? Yeah, probably something like that.

This isn't just a slap on the wrist. Withholding a salary is a major escalation, signaling the court's utter lack of patience with the NMMC's (in)action. Commuters stuck in Kharghar traffic while some bureaucrat drags their feet? Maybe *now* things will get moving.

Who knows what the underlying case is. Maybe it has to do with the broken promises of the metro expansion, or the crumbling state of the civic infrastructure in Panvel? Whatever it is, the High Court is signaling that someone will pay, literally, for the constant delays.

The next hearing should be interesting. Will the Commissioner magically find the resources to solve the problem? Or will we all be watching as their paycheck disappears? Stay tuned.
