> **TLDR**: A huge fire ripped through a company in Pawne MIDC. It's the kind of thing that makes you wonder if anyone checked the safety regulations. 

Pawne MIDC is currently battling a serious blaze. The fire broke out this morning at an unnamed company in Sector D, sending plumes of smoke billowing over the Taloja industrial area. 

Eyewitnesses report flames visible from the Sion-Panvel highway. Initial reports suggest the fire started around 8:00 AM, but the cause remains unknown. NMMC fire services are on scene, struggling to contain the inferno before it spreads to adjacent plots. It is unclear if there were any injuries. 

One nearby worker said, "The smoke is so thick, you can barely see across the street. Everyone's just standing around watching, hoping it doesn't get worse." It’s the kind of thing that makes you remember your own building’s fire escape plan (or lack thereof). More updates to follow as this story develops.
