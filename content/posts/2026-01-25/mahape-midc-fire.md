> **TLDR**: A major fire ripped through a chemical company in Mahape MIDC. Expect delays and a lot of finger-pointing about safety protocols.

Mahape MIDC turned into a smoke show this morning after a massive fire erupted at a chemical company. Think apocalyptic movie scene, but with more traffic.

Initial reports suggest the blaze started around 8:00 AM at a facility in Sector A. The exact cause is still under investigation, but eyewitnesses are whispering about mishandled chemicals (surprise!). Multiple fire tenders from Vashi and Rabale fire stations are on the scene, battling the inferno.

The smoke plume is visible from the Eastern Freeway. The NMMC disaster management cell is "monitoring the situation" – which is code for "we're scrambling." Expect road closures and diversions around the MIDC area. If you value your lungs, stay away.

Local industries are already raising questions about fire safety compliance in the MIDC. Remember the Taloja incident last year? Yeah, we haven't learned a thing. Someone's head will probably roll, but it won't un-burn the chemicals.
