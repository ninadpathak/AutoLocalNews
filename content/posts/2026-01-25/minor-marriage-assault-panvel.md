> **TLDR**: A tribal man in Navi Mumbai was arrested for marrying and assaulting a minor. Seriously, what is wrong with people?

Panvel Taluka Police Station arrested a 22-year-old man from Tembhode village. He's accused of marrying a 17-year-old girl and then, unbelievably, assaulting her. The FIR (First Information Report) was filed after the victim's family reported the incident.

The charges are serious. They fall under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, as well as sections of the Indian Penal Code related to marriage without consent. The police investigation is ongoing, focusing on establishing the full scope of the abuse and identifying any accomplices. Seriously, who does this guy think he is?

This isn't some faraway problem. Tembhode village is nestled in the hills near Panvel. It's a stark reminder that these issues exist right in our backyard. One hopes that this case gets swift justice and serves as a deterrent. The ₹0.00 worth of goodwill he had is now dust.
