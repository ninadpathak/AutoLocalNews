> **TLDR**: Mindscape Festival hits Nerul Rock Garden January 16-18 with free entry. Finally, something to do that won't empty your wallet.

Nerul's Rock Garden is about to get a whole lot more interesting. The Mindscape Festival is landing January 16th, running 'til the 18th. Think music, art, and maybe some vaguely existential vibes – all without costing you a single rupee.

No registration needed, just show up. The whole thing's being broadcast on their Insta (mindscapefestival). Expect a crowd; Sector 21 folks are always up for free stuff.

Will it be amazing? Will it be a flop? Who knows! But a free festival by the Koi pond is better than another weekend doomscrolling property prices. Grab a snack from that vada pav stall near the entrance – you know the one – and enjoy the show.
