> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai police arrested four for a trading app scam. Honestly, who *still* falls for this?

The Cyber Crime division of the Navi Mumbai police just took down a ring of scammers peddling bogus trading apps. Four guys are cooling their heels in the lockup after allegedly fleecing victims across the city. This isn't exactly rocket science, people. 

The con went something like this: Victims got bombarded with ads for trading apps promising insane returns. Download the app, deposit some cash, watch the fake profits roll in. Try to withdraw? Suddenly, there are “fees” and “taxes” and all kinds of BS designed to bleed you dry. Classic!

This particular crew operated out of… well, who knows? But their digital footprint led the cops to them, eventually. Details on the total amount swindled are still emerging, but we're betting it's a tidy sum. The NMMC should probably invest in some basic cyber-awareness education for its citizens.

If you or someone you know got taken for a ride, contact the Cyber Crime division immediately. And maybe, just *maybe*, stop believing everything you see on the internet.
