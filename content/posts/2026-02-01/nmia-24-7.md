> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai Airport is now running 24/7. Finally, you can fly out at 3 AM if that's your thing (or your only option).

Good news for the night owls (and the chronically delayed): Navi Mumbai's airport is officially a 24/7 operation. Forget those awkward red-eye flights from Mumbai; now you can take the Panvel local and fly out of NMIA whenever you please.

The shift to round-the-clock operations has been surprisingly smooth, according to sources, which is saying something given the usual chaos around here. No official statement has been made, but keep an eye on the departure boards after midnight.

What does this mean for Navi Mumbai? More flights, potentially lower fares (maybe!), and definitely a boost to the local economy. Just imagine the possibilities -- midnight biryani at Kharghar followed by a 3 AM flight to Goa. The future is now, folks.
