> **TLDR**: Two more arrested in ₹2.98 crore scam of elderly woman. Justice might *actually* happen this time.

Another chapter unfolds in the ₹2.98 crore con job targeting a senior citizen. Remember that story that made you want to throw your phone into the creek? Yeah, this is it.

The cybercrime unit just hauled in two more suspects, extending the roster of alleged fraudsters. This brings the total arrests to... well, enough to field a cricket team of criminals.

So far, the cops are being tight-lipped about the specifics. We do know the accused are cooling their heels in the lockup pending further investigation. Here's hoping the NMMC’s finest actually recover some of that hard-earned cash, preferably before the next election cycle. The victim, a resident of sector 17 in Vashi, must be thrilled.

The investigation continues, because ₹2.98 crore doesn't just vanish into thin air. Though, in Navi Mumbai, anything's possible. Stay tuned. We will be watching this one closely. And so should you.
