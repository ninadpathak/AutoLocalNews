> **TLDR**: Ganesh Naik, once a big shot, is now gunning for CM Shinde's political scalp. Expect fireworks (and maybe some traffic jams) in the run-up to the next election.

Ganesh Naik isn't happy. The former NCP heavyweight and ex-minister has declared open season on Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, promising to "wipe out" Shinde's influence, according to *The Indian Express*. Ouch.

Naik, a dominant figure in Navi Mumbai politics for decades, feels Shinde's rise has directly impacted his own power base. Remember those massive rallies at the CIDCO Exhibition Centre? Those days might be coming back.

The battleground? Expect a fierce fight for control of key institutions and local elections across Panvel, Airoli, and Belapur. Naik still commands considerable loyalty, particularly among the Agri and Koli communities. Shinde's Sena faction will need more than just bluster to counter that.

What does this mean for Navi Mumbai residents? Potentially, increased political activity and promises aplenty. Maybe even a few new projects near Nerul station. But expect disruptions and drama as the two titans clash. Grab your popcorn.
