> **TLDR**: Milind Vaidya, Shiv Sena (UBT) corporator, got booked for holding a rally without permission. Rules are for everyone else, apparently.

Another day, another politician thinking the rules don't apply to them. This time, it's Milind Vaidya, who decided his victory was so important, he'd ignore the little detail of, you know, getting permission for a rally.

Mahim police said “no” to Vaidya’s party on January 18 because of some rules in place until midnight on January 26. But Vaidya clearly thought his victory trumped all that.

So, now he's booked. Wonder if he'll claim he didn't know? Probably. The details of the charges are still murky, but it's another reminder that some people think they're above the law. Good for the police!

Will this actually change anything? Unlikely. Expect a slap on the wrist and another politician getting away with something. The fight continues for now.
