> **TLDR**: The NMMC election results are in, so get ready for some new faces running our city. Did your ward get someone competent, or just another guy who'll rename a chowk?

The final list of winning candidates from the BJP, Shiv Sena (UBT), MNS, and others is out. Sector 1's party scene is about to get a whole lot more interesting.

So, who's in? Check News18 for the full rundown. We're not going to list every single name; that's what interns are for. But expect some fresh blood – and the usual suspects – making decisions about your potholes and that weird smell near Turbhe station. 

Will this new batch actually fix anything? Will they finally deal with the dog menace in Seawoods? Or will they just spend the next five years arguing about statues and renaming things after dead politicians? Place your bets now.

One thing's for sure: election season is over, and the real games have just begun. Get ready for more drama, more promises, and probably, more disappointments. Welcome to Navi Mumbai, where the only thing predictable is the unpredictable nature of local politics.
