> **TLDR**: Draft energy policy suggests linking power tariffs to inflation and reducing cross-subsidies. Prepare for even more creative ways to save electricity (or just move to Lonavala). 

Hate your electricity bill? Get ready for round two. Some new draft policy is floating around that wants to link power tariffs to inflation. Meaning: when things get more expensive, *your electricity bill does too*. 

And it doesn't stop there. The policy also aims to curb cross-subsidies. Translation: the 'rich' using more power subsidizing the 'poor' using less might be a thing of the past. So, if you're in Sector 17 guzzling AC 24/7, you'll *really* feel it. 

The stated goal? To make the power sector financially viable. Our take? Another excuse to squeeze ₹₹₹ out of us. Expect vigorous debate from consumer groups and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) when this hits the table. Meanwhile, start unplugging stuff.
