> **TLDR**: The new Navi Mumbai airport has some good features, but also some problems, typical of infrastructure projects here. It's shiny, but is it actually convenient?

So, Condé Nast Traveller India took a look at the new Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), and, surprise, surprise, it's not all sunshine and imported sand. While the architecture looks impressive, and some of the tech is actually kinda cool, the report suggests some serious head-scratching moments.

Apparently, getting *to* the airport is still a pain. Like, *classic* Navi Mumbai pain. We're talking the usual bottlenecks around Panvel and the soul-crushing slog through Kharghar. Sector 14 residents might as well walk.

Inside, it's a mixed bag. Some travelers are raving about the fancy check-in tech, others are grumbling about the lack of clear signage. Sound familiar? And let's not even start on the food prices – ₹800 for a sandwich? Seriously?

The verdict? NMIA has potential, but it also needs some serious tweaking. Maybe spend less time on the aesthetics and more time on, you know, *actually making it easy to use*. Otherwise, it's just another gleaming monument to Navi Mumbai's infrastructural growing pains.
