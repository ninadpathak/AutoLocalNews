> **TLDR**: CISF cyclists are rolling into Mumbai on February 11th as part of a massive coastal ride. Expect spandex and maybe some sore bums.

Get ready to dodge some lycra! The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is bringing its "Cyclathon 2026" to our fair city. We're picturing a peloton of very serious cyclists hitting the streets.

They're slated to arrive in Mumbai around February 11th. After battling headwinds and questionable coastal highway planning, they'll cruise from Vasai-Virar down to the Gateway of India. Cultural programs are planned, so maybe they'll even get to see some actual culture before pedaling off again.

Their route south involves dodging potholes through Alibag, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg, before finally collapsing in Goa. This isn't just a fun ride; it’s a *massive* 6,553 km trek around the entire Indian coastline. Now *that's* cardio.

So, if you see a pack of cyclists looking slightly dazed near Belapur CBD, give them a wave. Or maybe just stay out of their way. Namaste, and may the road rash be ever in your favor.
