> **TLDR**: NMMC just snagged a Scotch Award for making property tax less of a headache. Seriously, anything that makes paying taxes slightly less soul-crushing is a win in our book.

NMMC is patting itself on the back. They won the Scotch Award 2025. Why? Because they dragged property tax kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

Apparently, their digital reforms and governance initiatives impressed the judges. Think online portals, streamlined payments, and less running around the NMMC headquarters in Belapur. Baby steps, people, but steps nonetheless.

Specifically, their property tax reforms got a shout-out. So, maybe, just maybe, that hike in property tax for Sector 17 wasn't *entirely* in vain. Or maybe it was. Jury is still out.

The award ceremony happened who-knows-where. But let's be real: the important part is that NMMC is (hopefully) using this as motivation to continue improving services. Maybe fixing those potholes on the Sion-Panvel highway is next? We can dream, right?

Next up: tackling water supply issues in Kharghar. Or maybe figuring out why the Airoli bridge always feels like a parking lot. The possibilities (and the problems) are endless. Either way, congrats, NMMC. Now, get back to work.
