> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai Airport aims for international flights in early 2026 after getting the green light for night flights. If you believe that, I have a bridge (or should I say, skywalk) to sell you.

Finally, some potentially good news about that airport we've all been hearing about forever. CEO Bansal says they're aiming to launch international operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027. That's basically early 2026 for those of us who don't speak corporate.

The big hurdle cleared? They finally got the permit for night flights. Because apparently, planes can only fly during the day in Navi Mumbai. Who knew?

Of course, this is all still "plans." Remember when they said the airport would be open in 2014? Or was it 2018? At this point, we're taking bets on which comes first: flying to Dubai from Navi Mumbai or the Seawoods Grand Central actually being finished.

Still, a glimmer of hope for those tired of trekking to Mumbai Airport. Imagine: no more crawling through the Vashi bridge traffic. Maybe Sector 12 residents can finally get some peace and quiet. Maybe.

Let's see if this actually happens. We're not holding our breath. The optimist says the airport will open in 2026. The realist says it will open the same day CIDCO finishes the housing lottery backlog.
