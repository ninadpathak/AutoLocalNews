> **TLDR**: A Panvel resident got a life sentence for killing two friends with a paver block back in 2017. Justice finally arrived, seven years late and with a healthy dose of closure for the victims' families.

Seven years after the brutal murder of two friends in Panvel, a court finally delivered its verdict. The accused, a local resident, will spend the rest of his natural life behind bars.

The victims, discovered near a desolate stretch off the Mumbai-Pune highway in October 2017, were bludgeoned to death with a paver block. The case hinged on circumstantial evidence and forensic reports.

Initially, the investigation crawled. The Panvel Taluka police faced immense pressure from local activist groups and the families of the deceased. Eventually, digital forensics cracked the case open.

According to the prosecution, a financial dispute triggered the gruesome act. The convicted had borrowed ₹50,000 from one of the victims and was unable to repay the debt, sources revealed.

The Additional Sessions Court in Panvel heard arguments from both sides for weeks. The defense argued for a lighter sentence, citing the accused's previously clean record and family responsibilities. The court wasn't buying it.

The judge, in his ruling, emphasized the brutality of the crime and the impact on the families. The life sentence, he stated, was commensurate with the gravity of the offense. Some say a life wasn't worth only ₹50,000.
