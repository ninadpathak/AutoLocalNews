> **TLDR**: Sunetra Pawar is now deputy CM; Prince Andrew's Epstein connections get messier. This week is *wild*.

So, Sunetra Pawar got sworn in as Maharashtra's Deputy CM. Just days after her husband's death. Politics, eh? Wonder what Ajit Pawar thinks of all this, considering the family drama is thicker than Kharghar traffic during peak hours.

Meanwhile, the Epstein files just dropped *more* bombs. This time? A photo of Prince Andrew. Seriously, that guy can't catch a break…or maybe he should have thought about that before hanging out with *that* crowd. The internet is already having a field day, naturally. Expect memes.

Baloch separatists went on the offensive in Balochistan, Pakistan, offing officials. Also, Amit Shah is still taking potshots at Mamata Banerjee. Some things never change. 

And just when you thought things couldn't get more depressing, turns out India's got a bit of an air pollution problem. Apparently, policies aren't quite lining up with the number of folks choking on Sector 17 air. Go figure.
