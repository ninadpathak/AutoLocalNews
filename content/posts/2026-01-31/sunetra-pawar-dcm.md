> **TLDR**: Sunetra Pawar is the new deputy CM, replacing her late husband, Ajit. Well, that was fast. 

The Raj Bhavan saw another oath-taking ceremony this weekend. This time, it was Sunetra Pawar stepping into the deputy CM's chair. Acharya Devvrat did the honors Saturday evening.

Sunetra Pawar takes over from her husband, Ajit, who, *checks notes*, tragically died mid-week in that suspicious plane crash. The speed of this succession is...something. Political wheels turn fast, especially when a seat opens up.

Expect the usual fanfare: garlands, awkward photos, and promises to "serve the people". The real question: will she continue Ajit’s commitment to turning every available open space into a cricket pitch?
