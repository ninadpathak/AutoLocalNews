> **TLDR**: A con artist, known for past gold-related scams, allegedly swindled a retired civil engineer. Victim lost ₹2.87 lakh after believing the suspect's fake gold story, *again*. 

The Panvel resident is probably kicking himself right now. He fell for *the oldest trick in the book*...again. Police say the suspect, already known for similar scams, sweet-talked the retiree into believing he had a stash of cheap gold. 

The victim handed over ₹2.87 lakh for this “opportunity”. The promised gold, predictably, never showed up. A complaint was filed at the Khandeshwar police station.

The accused is a repeat offender. Cops are digging through old case files. They think this could be connected to a series of similar gold schemes across Panvel and Kharghar.

Is this the start of a 'Grifting Season' in Navi Mumbai? Stay alert. If a stranger offers you suspiciously cheap gold near Khandeshwar station, run the other way. Just run.
