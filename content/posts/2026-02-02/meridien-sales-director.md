> **TLDR**: Firoz Sarwar is the new Director of Sales at Le Méridien. Another suit shuffles into another corner office; let's hope he knows where the good chai is.

Le Méridien, the giant glass box looming over Turbhe, has a new Director of Sales. Firoz Sarwar just snagged the gig.

Sarwar's job? To get more people booking rooms and stuffing themselves at their buffet. He’ll be hustling deals and schmoozing clients. Before Le Méridien, Sarwar was flexing his sales muscles at Radisson Blu in…wait for it…Ranchi. Before that it was Park Plaza in Kolkata.

So, can a guy from Ranchi sell luxury in Navi Mumbai? We’ll see if he can navigate the local market's quirks, from competing with the ITC Grand Central just across the creek in Parel to the local haunts in Vashi. Maybe he’ll even figure out why the pool is always empty. One thing's for sure though, he'll need to learn how to say "₹" real quick. Navi Mumbai ain't cheap, and neither are those fancy hotel rooms.
