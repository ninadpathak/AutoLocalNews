> **TLDR**: A Vashi businessman got fleeced for ₹1 crore in a stock investment scheme. Because trusting random tips on WhatsApp is always a great idea. 

Another day, another scam. This time, a Vashi-based businessman is lighter by ₹1 crore, thanks to a sophisticated stock investment fraud. The victim, lured by promises of quick riches, fell prey to smooth-talking con artists operating through WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

The scheme, as always, involved bogus stock tips and fake trading platforms designed to mimic genuine investment interfaces. After an initial "investment" showed impressive (but fabricated) returns, the businessman poured more money into the scheme. Once the con artists achieved their goal, communication ceased, and funds vanished.

The Vashi police station has registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC and the IT Act. Officials are warning residents about the dangers of unregulated investment schemes. Maybe think twice before you trust that random investment guru from sector 17, okay?
