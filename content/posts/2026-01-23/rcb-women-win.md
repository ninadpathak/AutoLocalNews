> **TLDR**: RCB Women finally won a match in Navi Mumbai! GG Women somehow managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. 

Okay, RCB Women fans, you can breathe. They finally did it. After a string of losses that made us question reality, they actually won a game at the DY Patil Stadium today. And against GG Women, no less.

GG Women looked set to cruise after setting a target that felt like a stroll in Sector 17. But then, things went full Navi Mumbai: unexpected, chaotic, and ultimately, a bit of a head-scratcher. RCB Women, fueled by Ellyse Perry's insane batting (a much-needed ₹2.2 Crore well spent!), clawed their way back. 

The turning point? Maybe it was that dropped catch near Nerul bridge. Maybe it was the sudden collapse of the GG Women's middle order faster than Panvel creek dries up in March. Whatever it was, GG Women imploded. RCB Women celebrated like they'd just won the World Cup. Maybe they had.
