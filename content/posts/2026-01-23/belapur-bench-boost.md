> **TLDR**: Volunteers painted 35 recycled plastic benches in CBD Belapur. Turns out, trash *can* be treasure, especially when it's Instagrammable.

CBD Belapur's getting a splash of color, and it's all thanks to recycled plastic. Forget drab grey concrete – we're talking vibrant public seating made from the stuff nobody wants.

As part of the Navi Mumbai Plastic and E-Waste Recyclothon, a crew of volunteers transformed 35 benches near Belapur station. They slapped on fresh coats of paint, turning discarded plastic into rest stops. Sector 15 residents, rejoice!

The benches aren't just pretty; they're practical proof that recycling works. Let's hope this sparks more green initiatives. Maybe they could tackle the overflowing bins near the Central Park metro station next?
