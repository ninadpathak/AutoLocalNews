> **TLDR**: A person is missing, and Navi Mumbai is on the lookout. Let's hope they're found safe, because disappearing isn't cool.

Seen this face around? A Reddit user, /u/xXMadeyeXx, posted a missing person appeal, and it's got us all wondering.

Details are scarce, but the image shows someone we need to find. Let's face it, getting lost in the NMMC maze between Nerul and Belapur is easy.

So, Navi Mumbai, eyes peeled! Have you spotted this person near Juinagar market or maybe wandering around DY Patil Stadium? Any info, even a hunch, could help bring them home. 

If you recognize this person, head over to the original Reddit post at /r/navimumbai and leave a comment for /u/xXMadeyeXx. Let's use the power of the internet for some actual good. If you have seen this person, contact the local police ASAP. Let's get this sorted.
