> **TLDR**: Can't find your polling booth? The official website is buried, but here it is. Good luck wading through government websites, you'll need it.

So, you want to vote, huh? That's cute. First, you gotta find where the heck you're supposed to vote. Turns out, the Election Commission of Maharashtra isn't making it easy.

After some digging (and a mild existential crisis), *The Record* found the link. It's [here](https://mahasecvoterlist.in/ObjectionOnClick/SearchVoterName). Prepare for a user interface straight out of 1998. Seriously, Netscape Navigator called, it wants its website back.

Type in your details, cross your fingers, and maybe you'll find your polling booth in Sector 6, or maybe not. Who knows? Happy voting!

And hey, if the website crashes (likely), don't blame us. Blame the system. And maybe pack a lunch. This could take a while.
