> **TLDR**: A woman's kurti was torn at Airoli station during the morning rush. The question: Is this a one-off, or yet another sign of commuter hell in Navi Mumbai? 

Another day, another disaster on the Harbour Line. A commuter reported on Reddit that someone tore her kurti this morning at Airoli station. Can we even be surprised anymore?

"Cultural_Opposite640" (Reddit handle, naturally) posted about the incident, sparking outrage (and, let's be honest, weary resignation) in the r/NaviMumbai and r/Airoli subreddits. The incident happened during the peak hours – imagine the sardine-can-esque conditions.

Look, we've all been crammed onto those local trains. But this? This is next-level. We're talking about a possible assault under the guise of peak-hour madness. Someone needs to check the CCTV at Airoli station's Platform 2 and figure out if this was accidental (unlikely) or something far more sinister. NMMC, are you listening?
