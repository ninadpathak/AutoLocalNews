> **TLDR**: Reddit user complains about rude moviegoers in Ulwe INOX. Some people clearly missed the memo on basic decency, again.

Ulwe INOX: A Reddit user, Kartoos17, reports a truly cinematic experience—and we don't mean the movie. Their post details a group of absolute legends who elevated movie-watching to a new level of annoyance. Imagine the smell.

First, the foot display. Bare, possibly fungal, feet were propped up on the seats. Then, the seat-kicking. Because legroom is just a suggestion, right? Finally, casual objectification of a girl taking photos. The trifecta of terribleness achieved.

The question is: what *do* you do? Do you channel your inner Singham and unleash righteous fury in the dark? Or do you passive-aggressively cough until they get the hint? Is there a middle ground between silent suffering and getting arrested?

Reddit chimes in, naturally. Suggestions range from confronting them directly (risky!) to passive-aggressive commentary. Some advise going full “Karen” and finding a manager. If you have to ask the manager, is society doomed?

Next time you're at INOX Little World Mall, remember: some people treat public spaces like their living room floor. And apparently, their feet smell like it too.
