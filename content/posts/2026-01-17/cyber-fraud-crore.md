> **TLDR**: A senior citizen in Navi Mumbai got scammed out of ₹4 Crore. Scammers are working overtime, and maybe it's time to hide under a rock.

Another day, another cybercrime. This time, some poor soul in Navi Mumbai kissed ₹4 Crore goodbye thanks to those digital bandits. Seriously, is anyone safe?

Details are scarce, but the Times of India reports that an elderly resident fell victim to sophisticated cyber fraud. Crores, GONE. This isn't pocket change; this is someone's life savings.

Navi Mumbai's cyber cell is "investigating," which is comforting, I guess. But let's be real, these digital pickpockets are slick. They're always a step ahead.

How do you protect yourself? Honestly, at this point, I'm considering going full Luddite. Maybe it's time to ditch the smartphone and communicate by carrier pigeon. At least the birds won't steal your retirement fund. And if they do, it's probably due to crows. And a crow murder you can see coming. Digital theft? Not so much. Stay safe out there, folks. And maybe keep your life savings under your mattress. Or in a crow.
