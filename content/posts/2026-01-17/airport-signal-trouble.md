> **TLDR**: Mobile networks near the new Navi Mumbai airport are reportedly a mess. Telcos are begging TRAI to step in before it becomes a total communication black hole.

Chaos is brewing before the first flight even takes off. Telcos are officially fed up with signal issues plaguing the area around the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA).

Apparently, getting a decent mobile signal near Sector 112 is harder than finding parking in Vashi during rush hour. Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea have collectively filed a plea with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), according to *BusinessLine*.

The issue? Infrastructure bottlenecks and what they describe as "uncooperative" local authorities. Translation: Someone's not playing nice with the network towers.

Imagine thousands of travelers descending upon NMIA, only to find their phones useless. Calls dropping faster than the Sensex on a bad day. Instagram stories failing to upload. The horror!

The telcos want TRAI to play referee and force everyone to cooperate. They are hoping TRAI can strong-arm the concerned parties into fixing the network before paying passengers start complaining about the lack of 5G while waiting for their luggage.

Whether TRAI can untangle this mess before the grand opening remains to be seen. But one thing's for sure: if you're planning to fly in or out of NMIA anytime soon, maybe pack a backup carrier pigeon... just in case.
