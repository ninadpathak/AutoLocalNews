> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai accountant got fleeced for ₹1.3 crore in an insurance scam. Turns out "guaranteed returns" are only guaranteed to empty your bank account.

Another day, another fraud in NMMC. This time, an accountant from Sector 17, Vashi, got conned out of a staggering ₹1.3 crore. The bait? Sweet promises of sky-high returns on an insurance policy.

The fraudsters, now booked by the cybercrime cell, spun a web of lies. They lured the victim with assurances that made even the most seasoned investor drool. The gang operated between August 2023 and May 2024.

The victim, blinded by greed or maybe just wishful thinking, transferred the colossal sum in installments. The police have registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC and the IT Act. Four suspects are now persons of interest.

So, next time someone promises you the moon on an insurance policy, remember this Sector 17 accountant. That pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? It's probably just fool's gold. The NMMC Police HQ urges residents to practice extreme caution.
