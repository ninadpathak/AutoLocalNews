> **TLDR**: The state cabinet greenlit the Nerul-Uran metro extension to the new airport. Now, maybe we can *actually* fly somewhere on time.

So, it's official. The Maha Vikas Aghadi Cabinet, fresh off their Ganpati holiday, approved the ₹5,600 Crore metro link to the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) yesterday. Someone deserves a modak.

The 27-kilometer extension of Metro Line 1 (Nerul to Uran) will connect Kharkopar to the airport. That's right, folks – Sector 18, Uran *might* finally be relevant. The project is slated to be complete by… well, sometime before the heat death of the universe, probably.

Key stops include Sector 20, Sector 22, and the Navi Mumbai International Airport station itself. Think of all the auto rickshaw fares you'll save! (Or, you know, spend on overpriced airport coffee.)

The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) will be footing most of the bill. Guess those property taxes are finally going somewhere useful. Maybe they'll even fix the potholes on Palm Beach Road with the change. Probably not, though.

This isn't just about getting to the airport faster. It's about (potentially) unlocking serious economic growth in the Panvel-Uran region. So, while we wait for the trains to *actually* start running, let's just hope they don't run out of steam… or get stuck behind a VIP convoy.
