> **TLDR**: The Mumbai-Navi Mumbai airport metro line is greenlit. Now we just have to wait another decade for it to actually open.

Thank God, the government finally approved Metro Line 8. We're talking about the 35-km link that will (eventually) connect CSMIA (Mumbai Airport) to NMIA (Navi Mumbai Airport). Maybe, just maybe, we can ditch that awful airport bus.

Twenty stations are planned along the route. The goal? Seamless travel between the two airports. Supposedly, this will slash travel times. We'll believe it when we see it.

Don't hold your breath, though. This is MMRDA we're talking about. Remember the delays with Line 1? Expect similar chaos here.

The upside? Property values in Dronagiri and Ulwe are about to skyrocket. Time to call your broker (not financial advice).

Imagine: skipping the insane Panvel traffic. Just hop on the metro. It's a beautiful dream... that probably won't happen until 2035.
