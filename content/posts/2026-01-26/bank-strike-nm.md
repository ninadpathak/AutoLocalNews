> **TLDR**: Banks are striking Tuesday. Prepare for ATM lines longer than the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link.

Heads up, Navi Mumbai! Your Tuesday is about to get complicated. A nationwide bank strike is scheduled for January 27th, 2026. Translation? Expect longer queues than usual at ATMs and online banking meltdowns.

Several major public sector banks are participating. This includes heavy hitters like the State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda. Private banks *might* be open, but don't bet your bottom rupee on it.

What can you *actually* do? Plan ahead. Stock up on cash. Maybe finally learn how to use UPI properly. Because facing the reality of a cash crunch in Nerul East at 8 PM is *not* going to be fun.

Why the strike? Something about "better wages" and "job security." Honestly, who knows? All you need to know is your weekend just got a whole lot more 'run around to different ATMs' before they dry up. Good luck, you'll need it.
