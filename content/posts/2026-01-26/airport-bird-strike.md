> **TLDR**: DGCA is investigating bird strike risks near the NMIA. Turns out, building an airport next to a wetland might be a bad idea.

So, the inevitable has happened. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is poking around the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) site, worried about birds turning into airplane-shaped projectiles. Apparently, a giant flock of feathered friends wasn't factored into the grand plan. 

The investigation zone covers a 3km radius around the airport, focusing on potential bird attractants. We're betting the DGCA will find more than a few, given Panvel creek's prime location right next door. Wetland ecosystems are pretty popular with birds.

Expect a report soon. Maybe it will suggest moving the birds? Or perhaps the airport? Either way, someone’s going to have a very bad day when they realise the potential disaster they could have caused.

In the meantime, let's hope pilots have their bird-strike insurance paid up. And maybe NMIAL can invest in some REALLY loud noise cannons.
