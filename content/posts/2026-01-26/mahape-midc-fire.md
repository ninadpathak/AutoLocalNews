> **TLDR**: A major fire ripped through a chemical factory in Mahape MIDC. Guess someone forgot fire safety wasn't optional.

Black smoke billowed over Mahape this morning as a chemical unit went up in flames. Forget your chai break; this was a full-blown inferno.

The CNBC TV18 footage showed flames leaping from the factory, located in the Phase II area. Initial reports suggest the fire started around 10:00 AM, but the cause remains unknown. Probably some genius playing with Bunsen burners.

Multiple fire tenders from the MIDC fire station and surrounding areas responded. Let's hope they brought enough water this time.

Details are still emerging. No word yet on casualties or the specific chemicals involved. Stay tuned. We'll update as soon as we hear more from the authorities (if they ever answer their phones).

Meanwhile, avoid the area. Unless you enjoy inhaling toxic fumes and watching things burn, maybe grab a vada pav somewhere far, far away.
