> **TLDR**: NMMC Commissioner Rajesh Narvekar reviewed civic projects; we're cautiously optimistic. Will Sector 17 ever get decent roads? Only time will tell.

Rajesh Narvekar is making the rounds, clipboard in hand. The NMMC Commissioner spent yesterday grilling department heads on the status of everything from road repairs in Vashi to water supply improvements in Dronagiri. 

Specifics mentioned included the progress of the Nerul-Uran railway line (finally!) and the ongoing saga of pothole eradication, especially around the Turbhe MIDC area. No word yet on when we can expect flying cars, but one can dream.

Narvekar also addressed concerns about public service delivery, particularly regarding sanitation in the slums of Sector 5, and the ever-contentious issue of illegal construction near the Kopri bridge. Expect increased enforcement.

Will this inspection translate into actual change? The proof, as always, will be in the (lack of) potholes on your daily commute. Keep an eye out, Navi Mumbaikars. Let us know if you see any real improvements. (Or spectacular failures!).
