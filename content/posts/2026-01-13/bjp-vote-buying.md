Cash-for-votes allegations hit Kamothe harder than peak hour traffic this week. One resident of sector [insert sector number] claims BJP workers went door-to-door, handing out ₹2,000 notes like they were election pamphlets. The user, Enough_Teach_3063, posted on Reddit's r/NaviMumbai to share their experience. 

The poster alleges that their brother got the cash. Then, boom, a call from a BJP candidate showed up on the phone. The poster noted the brazenness of the operation. This wasn't some back-alley deal; it was a full-on voter outreach program with a side of suspected bribery.

"There was no attempt to hide what was happening," they wrote. "Cash distribution and follow-up calls were happening in parallel." Now, the question is whether this Kamothe case is a one-off or part of a bigger trend. Have you seen anything similar, Navi Mumbai? Let us know. This isn't 'allegedly' news; it's a call for receipts.
