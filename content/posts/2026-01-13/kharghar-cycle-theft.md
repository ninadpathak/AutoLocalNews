> **TLDR**: A Kharghar commuter's cycle got nicked from the station. A lawyer mysteriously appeared right after.

Another day, another cycle theft at Kharghar station. This time, it's a Rockrider MTB-ST 100 that vanished from its usual spot near the pay-and-park. The owner, a 19-year-old identified only as /u/Remote-Rip-1405, locked it at 6:30 AM; gone by 10 PM.

Here's where it gets weird. As the victim left the station, a lawyer – out of nowhere – offered his card. Claimed to specialize in criminal and civil law. Talk about opportune timing, right? He even does small cases, apparently. 

The Kharghar cops now have a missing cycle report. No fee, at least. As for the lawyer? User /u/Remote-Rip-1405 did some digging and says he seems legit, but still…what a day. The police will investigate, but honestly, keep an eye on your rides, folks. Especially near Kharghar station.
