> **TLDR**: Many Navi Mumbai workers in 24/7 jobs can't vote despite the public holiday. Is democracy just a suggestion for some companies?

The “election holiday” feels like a joke for many in Navi Mumbai. While the government patted itself on the back, employees in hospitals, call centers and security services are still stuck at work.

One user on r/navimumbai summed it up: "No holiday. No half day. No WFH. Just 'manage somehow.'" Seriously?

This isn't about laziness; it's about a basic right. Are companies in the TTC industrial area and Belapur CBD so important that they can ignore the democratic process? Are votes from Nerul less valuable than profits?

The NMMC needs to stop pretending this isn’t happening. Maybe some rules with teeth are in order. Otherwise, call it “Election Day (Terms & Conditions Apply)."

How many votes were lost because someone was stuck on a shift? Someone should find out.
