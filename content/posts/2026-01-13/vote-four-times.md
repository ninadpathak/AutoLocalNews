> **TLDR**: New voting rules mean four corporators per ward. Get ready to cast four votes, folks; it's gonna be wild.

Confused about the election buzz? The NMMC has switched things up. Now, each ward gets *four* corporators instead of one. Buckle up, because you'll be voting four times to make it happen. 

Think of it as quadrupling your civic duty. When you head to the polling booth in Sector 17 (or wherever!), you'll see multiple EVMs. No, your eyes aren't deceiving you. Each machine represents a different seat.

White, pink, yellow, and blue – each EVM has a color to help you sort it out. It's like a bizarre, pastel-colored lottery. The NMMC hopes this reduces confusion, but we're not holding our breath. Let's just hope the power doesn't go out in the middle of it all. Imagine *that* chaos.
