> **TLDR**: AC local trains are *finally* rolling onto the Harbour Line from January 26th. About time they dragged themselves into the 21st century, right?

Thank heavens for small mercies. The Harbour Line, often feeling like a mobile sauna, is about to get a whole lot cooler. Mark January 26th on your calendar, because that's when the AC local services *finally* kick off.

Imagine: no more battling for that sliver of shade by the door at Nerul. No more arriving at CSMT looking like you’ve just run a marathon. Just sweet, sweet, air-conditioned bliss. Let's hope they crank up the AC enough to offset peak hour body heat.

The initial rollout will see a limited number of services. Expect the usual teething problems as they work out the bugs. But hey, at least it's a start. Maybe, just maybe, we can finally ditch those sweat-soaked commutes and arrive at work vaguely human.

Word is, commuters from Panvel to Goregaon should benefit initially. Now if they could just fix the signal failures and the overflowing ladies' compartments, we might be onto something. One can dream, right?
