> **TLDR**: The Chougule family basically runs Airoli-Digha now, politically speaking. Is anyone *really* surprised that local politics feels like a family business?

Looks like the Chougules are the new kings of Airoli-Digha. Newsband is reporting that the family has solidified its political grip on the area.

Basically, if you want anything done in Wards 1 through whatever, you're going through them. Ward dominance confirmed.

It's not exactly news that local politics can be…incestuous. But the scale here is pretty impressive.

Rumors of challenges from other parties are around sector 14, but the Chougule political network seems untouchable.

So, next time you're stuck in traffic near the Digha railway station, remember who *really* runs the show. Maybe they can fix the potholes. Probably not, though.
