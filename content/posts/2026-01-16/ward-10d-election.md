> **TLDR**: Counting started at 10 am for NMMC Ward 10D. Prepare for political theatrics, maybe some chai spills.

Buckle up, Nerul. The ballot counting bonanza for NMMC Ward 10D kicked off at 10 this morning, according to *some* news outlets. We're picturing more drama than a Balaji Telefilms production.

Expect the usual suspects: frantic phone calls, whispered deals, and nervous candidates mainlining caffeine. The real question is: will anyone challenge the early frontrunners? Or will Sector 21 residents be stuck with the same old promises?

Keep an eye on the battle for supremacy between the usual suspects. Word on the street (from our completely reliable vada pav vendor source) is that independent candidates might actually shake things up this time. Imagine!

Whoever wins, prepare for endless victory processions clogging up the already nightmarish Sion-Panvel highway. Maybe just stay home and order pizza. Consider it a public service.
