> **TLDR**: Multiple cylinders exploded in Nerul Sector 20, causing panic. We're guessing someone's chai plans are ruined.

Sector 20 just got a whole lot louder. Residents reported hearing a series of explosions around [TIME - confirm time of incident]. Initial reports suggest 4-5 cylinders detonated.

The cause is still unknown, but we're betting someone wasn't paying attention while changing their gas connection. No official statement yet from the fire department or the Nerul police station.

Early reports suggest that the explosions took place [SPECIFY LOCATION: e.g., "near the Sector 20 market", "behind the D-Mart in Sector 20", or "in the slums near sector 20"]. We're waiting for confirmation if anyone got hurt.

Hopefully, this is just a noisy accident and not a sign of something worse. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. Meanwhile, maybe stick to ordering pizza tonight.
