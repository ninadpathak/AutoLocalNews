> **TLDR**: A nasty accident shut down Palm Beach Road yesterday. Details are scarce, but social media has hints, as always.

Someone on Reddit is asking the real questions: what's the story with that Palm Beach Road crash? The user, Old-Reflection-2481, posted a link to a disturbing Instagram reel.

We clicked (so you don't have to). It's a mangled car. Seriously, twisted metal and shattered glass all over the place. No official word from the cops in Sector 11, Nerul, as of this morning, but the video paints a grim picture.

No confirmation on injuries, fatalities, or causes. The accident apparently snarled traffic heading towards Belapur for hours. Standard Tuesday, then.

If you've got info, drop it in the comments. Let's get some facts before the WhatsApp rumour mill kicks into overdrive. We are better than that, Navi Mumbai.
