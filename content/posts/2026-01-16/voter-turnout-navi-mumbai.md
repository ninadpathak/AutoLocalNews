> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai crushed Thane in voter turnout for civic polls. Apparently, someone actually cares about Panvel's potholes.

Navi Mumbai showed up to vote like they were promised free pav bhaji, clocking a sweet 57% turnout in the Maharashtra civic body elections. Thane, meanwhile, barely managed 54%. Were they all stuck in Ghodbunder Road traffic? Probably.

The numbers put Navi Mumbai at the top of the MMR region. Panvel, especially, saw some action. Maybe all those complaints about crumbling infrastructure finally spurred people into action.

Across the state, it was a mixed bag. Some cities were buzzing, others were snoozing. But hey, at least Navi Mumbai didn't embarrass itself. Next step: demanding better footpaths in Nerul Sector 21.
