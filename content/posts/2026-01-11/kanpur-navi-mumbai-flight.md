> **TLDR**: IndiGo will start direct flights between Kanpur and Navi Mumbai by the end of January. Finally, a way to escape UP without a 27-hour train ride!

Finally, Kanpur-wallahs, your Navi Mumbai commute just got an upgrade! IndiGo is launching direct flights between Kanpur and our fair city before February hits. No more layovers or questionable train food. Think of all the momos you can buy with the saved travel time.

The Times of India reports the service will begin by January-end. The exact date and schedule are still hush-hush. But this link bridges Uttar Pradesh directly to our concrete jungle. Expect the usual scramble for inaugural flight tickets.

This new route is a win for Navi Mumbai's growing airport. Forget battling Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. Now, Kanpur's textile barons can land directly in our backyard and close deals over vada pav near the APMC market. Finally, less crowded trains. That's a win for everyone.
