> **TLDR**: Hindu group protested an H&M ad they found offensive. Next time, maybe stick to selling clothes, guys.

Outside the H&M showroom in Seawoods Grand Central Mall, things got spicy this afternoon. A group chanting the Hanuman Chalisa gathered to protest what they deemed an “offensive” advertisement displayed in the store's window.

What was the ad? Details are hazy, but it was apparently enough to trigger the ire of a local pro-Hindu organization. We're reaching out to H&M for comment – maybe it was a rogue mannequin situation?

The protesters claim the ad hurt religious sentiments. The Vashi police showed up to keep things from escalating beyond chanting and placard-waving. No arrests were made, but the fashion police might need to get involved.

Seawoods residents reported traffic snarls near the mall as the protest gained momentum. Seems like H&M learned today that in Navi Mumbai, even fast fashion can move slowly.
