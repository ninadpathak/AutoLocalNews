> **TLDR**: NMMC installs mini-libraries at bus stops. Finally, something useful from the corporation that isn't a pothole.

Tired of doom-scrolling while waiting for the 520 LTD? Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) heard your silent screams and installed mini-libraries at bus shelters across the city.

Imagine this: you're at the Nerul Sector 21 bus stop, already late. Instead of watching another Instagram reel, you can grab a Chetan Bhagat novel. Instantaneously, you're cultured!

These aren't exactly the libraries of Alexandria. Shelves stock a rotating selection of books – from self-help to potboilers. Think of it as a literary lucky dip, managed by local NGOs. The NMMC hopes this'll turn bus stops into community hubs, and honestly, we're here for it.

Will this solve Navi Mumbai's traffic woes? Nope. Will it make the wait for that delayed NMMT bus slightly less soul-crushing? Absolutely. Now, if only they'd install charging points...
