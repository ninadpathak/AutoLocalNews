> **TLDR**: Mumbai Indians crushed Delhi Capitals by 50 runs. Another day, another reminder that Mumbai owns this tournament.

The Capitals just got schooled. Harmanpreet hammered 55, Nat Sciver-Brunt blasted 32, and MI's bowlers choked the life out of DC's chase. The final score? A brutal 159 for 5 against a paltry 109 for 9.

Harmanpreet's knock wasn't just runs; it was a masterclass in timing, peppered with sixes that landed somewhere near Panvel. Sciver-Brunt played the perfect second fiddle, ensuring the momentum never dipped. DC's bowling attack, usually sharp, looked blunter than a Nerul construction site drill.

Then came the choke. DC's batting lineup folded faster than a cheap vada pav stand in the rain. Only Jess Jonassen showed some fight with 42, but even that felt like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. MI's Saika Ishaque snagged three wickets for just 11 runs. Absolute demolition.

The message from DY Patil Stadium is clear: Mumbai isn't just playing; they're dominating. As for Delhi? They need a serious rethink, and maybe a vada pav from outside the stadium for good luck. It couldn't hurt.
