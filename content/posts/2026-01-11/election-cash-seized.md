> **TLDR**: ₹16.16 lakh in unaccounted cash was seized in Navi Mumbai ahead of local elections. Apparently, some people still think stuffing briefcases with cash is a viable campaign strategy.

Local body elections are heating up, and so is the NMMC's anti-corruption drive. A cool ₹16.16 lakh in cold, hard cash was seized in Navi Mumbai, according to *Mid-day*. No names are being dropped yet, but someone’s campaign just took a serious hit.

Where did this cash come from? Your guess is as good as ours. Was it destined for dodgy backroom deals? Maybe it was a last-minute slush fund. One thing's for sure: the NMMC is on high alert.

The seizure underscores the challenges of keeping elections clean, even at the local level. Every rupee counts, and ₹16.16 lakh can buy a whole lot of votes (or at least, a whole lot of chai and samosas for potential voters) in places like Belapur and Nerul. This sets the stage for a potentially explosive election season.
