> **TLDR**: Over a thousand students made a human chain to encourage voting in the upcoming NMMC elections. Let's hope they understand the irony of forced participation promoting free will.

Forget flash mobs. The new hotness? Human chains for democracy! 1100 students snaked through Vashi this morning, holding hands to raise awareness for the 2026 NMMC elections.

Organized by the Thane Zilla Parishad, the chain stretched from outside the APMC market in Sector 19 to… well, somewhere else in Vashi. Details are sketchy. Mid-day (who else?) covered it.

Sources say the goal was to boost voter turnout. Which, let's be honest, could use a boost. Will hand-holding teens actually make a difference? Unclear.

Look, any effort to get people to vote is… something. But maybe instead of forced displays of civic duty, we could, I don't know, fix the potholes on the Thane-Belapur road? Just a thought. Maybe then people would feel like their voices matter.

Anyway, photo ops were plentiful. Expect to see those smiles plastered all over the NMMC website. Remember them when your building's water supply gets cut off *again*.
