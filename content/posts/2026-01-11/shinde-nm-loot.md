> **TLDR**: BJP Minister Ganesh Naik accuses CM Shinde of looting the NMMC treasury. Expect fireworks in the upcoming election season.

Ganesh Naik (BJP) didn't mince words. He said that Eknath Shinde, before becoming Chief Minister, ransacked the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) treasury.

According to Naik, Shinde greenlit a bunch of unnecessary projects to benefit cronies before leaving the NMMC. We're talking about crores of rupees, possibly earmarked for Sector 14's development, now allegedly lining someone else's pockets.

Naik claims Shinde fast-tracked approvals for projects that weren't needed. He suggests the timing (right before Shinde's exit) is more than suspicious. "A complete disregard for financial prudence," Naik stated at a press conference near the APMC market. Naik didn't provide specific figures, but promised to reveal all in due course. 

Naik's attack sets the stage for a nasty election season. Expect more accusations, more numbers, and more political drama unfolding near you. Buckle up.
