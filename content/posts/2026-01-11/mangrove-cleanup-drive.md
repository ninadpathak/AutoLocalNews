> **TLDR**: Vanashakti and Yatri organized a mangrove clean-up in Navi Mumbai. Finally, some good news about Sector 16's favorite trees.

Gloves on, bags ready. Activists from Vanashakti and volunteers from Yatri (that travel app) ditched the AC and tackled the grim reality of Navi Mumbai's mangroves. The target? Piles of plastic choking the delicate ecosystem.

We're talking about the muddy mess near the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary. Sector 16 residents know the spot – usually beautiful, frequently trashed. Vanashakti, as always, spearheaded the effort, reminding everyone that pretty birds need clean habitats.

Yatri chipped in with manpower. Good for them. Let’s hope it wasn’t just a photo op and they actually got their shoes dirty. The before-and-after pics, though, are genuinely impressive. Less plastic, more mangrove.

Now, if we could just convince the rest of Navi Mumbai to stop treating our natural treasures like garbage dumps. Baby steps, people. Baby steps.
