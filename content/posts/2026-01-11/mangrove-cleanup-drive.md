> **TLDR**: Vanashakti and Yatri teamed up for a mangrove cleanup. Let's hope this isn't a yearly tradition because people keep trashing the place.

Another weekend, another cleanup. NGO Vanashakti, along with the Yatri Motorcycle Club, hauled trash from a section of Navi Mumbai's precious mangrove forest.

The drive focused on Sector 28, Vashi, near the creek. Volunteers filled bags with plastic bottles, food wrappers, and the usual assortment of garbage choking the ecosystem. Imagine riding your bike out there for that! Good on them, I guess.

While the cleanup is commendable, it's a band-aid on a bigger problem. The relentless dumping of waste into these ecologically sensitive areas continues unabated. The NMMC needs to step up enforcement, and *maybe* people should stop treating the mangroves like a personal landfill. Otherwise, expect this to be an annual event. Same time, same place, same… garbage.
