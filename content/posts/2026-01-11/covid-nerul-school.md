> **TLDR**: 18 students at a Nerul school tested positive for COVID, raising concerns about a new outbreak. This is either a blip or the start of something bigger – place your bets, folks.

A private school in Nerul's Sector 21 is dealing with a COVID-19 cluster. 18 students have tested positive since last week, forcing the school to shut down temporarily.

The news has parents scrambling. Are we back to online classes and existential dread? Or is this just a minor scare before things return to normal? The NMMC health department is scrambling to trace contacts, so expect delays if you know anyone in the area.

According to sources (okay, fine, *a* source), the school will be sanitized over the weekend. Reopening is scheduled for next week, pending further test results. Let's hope this is just a localized problem. Otherwise, we're dusting off those Zoom backgrounds and remembering how to mute ourselves.
