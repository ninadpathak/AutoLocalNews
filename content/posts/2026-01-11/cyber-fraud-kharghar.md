A student residing in Sector 12, Kharghar, lost ₹2 lakh to cyber fraud, a sum that included crucial scholarship money. The incident, reported to the Cyber Crime cell of the Navi Mumbai Police, underscores the escalating threat of online scams targeting vulnerable individuals, especially students dependent on financial aid.

The student, whose name is being withheld, received a fraudulent link disguised as an update from their bank. Upon clicking the link and entering their credentials, ₹2 lakh was swiftly siphoned from their account. This incident raises serious questions about the efficacy of cybersecurity awareness programs targeted at Navi Mumbai's student population, particularly given the reliance on digital banking platforms. The Kharghar police are currently investigating the digital trail, a process often hampered by the sophisticated techniques employed by cybercriminals operating from outside the NMMC jurisdiction. 

This incident arrives amidst the NMMC's ongoing push for digital literacy, suggesting a gap between the government's initiatives and the practical realities of online safety. Whether the NMMC will ramp up cybersecurity awareness campaigns, allocating specific resources to educate students on phishing tactics and safe online banking, remains to be seen. Failure to do so risks jeopardizing the educational aspirations of many students in Navi Mumbai.
