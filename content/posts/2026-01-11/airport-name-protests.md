> **TLDR**: All-party meeting today will decide whether to launch further protests against the naming of Navi Mumbai Airport. Expect drama, because when *doesn't* Navi Mumbai have drama?

The naming saga of Navi Mumbai International Airport continues. An all-party meeting is scheduled today to decide whether to escalate protests. At stake? The name: D.B. Patil International Airport – a proposal that's ignited passions across Panvel and beyond.

The meeting, convened by the Sarvapakshiya D.B. Patil Navi Mumbai International Airport Name Action Committee, kicks off at 11 AM. Representatives from various political parties and social organizations will be there.

What’s the beef? Many locals feel the government is dragging its feet on honoring D.B. Patil, a leader of the land rights movement. Previous protests caused major disruptions, remember the highway blockade near Kharghar? Another round could mean more traffic chaos.

The airport is almost ready. But who gets the bragging rights on its name is still a hot topic. Watch this space. Expect an update as soon as the yelling stops.
