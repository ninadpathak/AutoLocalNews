> **TLDR**: Protests over the Navi Mumbai airport's name might ramp up today after a key meeting. Expect more roadblocks and shouting matches; business as usual in Panvel.

The naming drama at the Navi Mumbai International Airport is far from over. Today's meeting of various groups will decide whether to unleash another wave of protests. Remember the last one? Chaos near Panvel station, burning tires, the whole nine yards.

At the core: a battle between supporters of D.B. Patil and Shiv Sena founder, Balasaheb Thackeray. The state government went with Thackeray's name. Patil's supporters? Not happy. They want the airport named after the Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) leader, a hero to the *Aagri* and *Koli* communities.

So, what's next? Expect more *morchas* aimed at CIDCO Bhavan in CBD Belapur. Likely roadblocks around the Sion-Panvel highway. The only thing guaranteed is more traffic headaches for anyone trying to reach the city's new aerial gateway. Place your bets, folks.
