> **TLDR**: CIDCO's metro whizzed from Pendhar to Central Park flawlessly. Finally, something in this city works on the first try.

Guess what actually worked for once? CIDCO finally did a successful trial run of the Navi Mumbai Metro, Line 1, from Pendhar to Central Park this morning. Yes, you read that right. No delays (this time!).

The train smoothly sailed through the 11 stations, proving that maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to ditch the auto-rickshaw mafia someday. Each station platform was tested, along with safety measures and signalling. Fancy stuff, if you're into that sort of thing.

So, when can you ride it? No one actually knows. But at least they’re testing. Meanwhile, the Kharghar residents association is collecting bets on the actual opening date. Place your bets now folks.
