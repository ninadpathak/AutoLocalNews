> **TLDR**: CIDCO ran a metro trial from Pendhar to Central Park. Good news if you like trains; bad news if you hate construction.

Finally! The Navi Mumbai Metro *might* actually happen. CIDCO successfully completed a trial run on Line 1, from Pendhar in Sector 12 to Central Park in Sector 23. This isn't a drill (probably).

The train trundled along the 11-km stretch, a tiny victory after years of delays. Remember when they said it would open in 2016? Good times.

No date for actual passenger service yet. But hey, at least the train *moved*. Maybe Sector 5, Kharghar residents can ditch the overcrowded buses soon. Or maybe not. We're not holding our breath, but it is a start. The project's new deadline, according to sources inside CIDCO, is late 2024.

Now, about that Nerul-Uran line...
