> **TLDR**: CIDCO's metro line is closer than ever after a successful trial run. Finally, something actually works in this city.

The Navi Mumbai Metro chugged along its Pendhar to Central Park route today for a successful trial run. Finally, after what feels like a decade of delays, Sector 14 might actually be accessible. 

CIDCO officials confirmed the train smoothly navigated the 11-km stretch. The grey line promises to link Panvel to Belapur in Phase 1. Belapur! Remember Belapur? That's where all the government offices are. Prepare for less crowded locals and maybe even a slightly shorter commute.

But hold on, don't sell your car just yet. The real test will be passenger service and whether the line actually sticks to a schedule. Until then, we remain cautiously optimistic. Consider this a small win, a tiny victory against the forces of infrastructure ineptitude.
