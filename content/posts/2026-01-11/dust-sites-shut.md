> **TLDR**: NMMC cracked down on 19 construction sites for spewing dust. Developers are coughing up fines—hopefully, that’ll help them clean up their act.

Another day, another dust storm choking Navi Mumbai. This time, though, the NMMC actually did something. They swooped in and shut down 19 construction sites for violating pollution norms. About time.

According to Mid-day, a whopping 173 developers also got slapped with penalty notices. While the article doesn't mention specific monetary amounts, we're betting these fines smart. After all, who wants to pay to pollute?

The usual suspects – dust, debris, and general construction chaos – were cited as the reasons for the crackdown. Residents near Sector 15 in CBD Belapur and along the Taloja MIDC stretch have been complaining about the air quality for months. Let's see if this is more than just a PR stunt and the NMMC actually continues to enforce the rules. Maybe, just maybe, we can breathe a little easier this monsoon.
