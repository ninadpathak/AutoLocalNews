> **TLDR**: Delhi Capitals won the toss and chose to bowl against Mumbai Indians. Honestly, another toss, another predictable choice.

Delhi Capitals skipper, Rishabh Pant, just made the least surprising decision of the IPL season. He won the toss at Wankhede and elected to bowl first against the Mumbai Indians. No shocker there. Dew, they say. Plus, everyone wants to chase under the lights. 

MI's Rohit Sharma is back as an impact player, which is good news for the home side faithful. However, they'll need more than nostalgia to overcome a DC team desperate for points. They'll need to find ways of getting runs, and runs fast. 

DC's Khaleel Ahmed will be licking his lips. The Wankhede pitch is a paradise for seam bowlers early on. Expect fireworks (hopefully of the cricketing variety) from over one, with perhaps even a big appeal or two. By the looks of it, the stage is set for yet another high-octane IPL clash that's set to have the crowd at the edge of their seat.
