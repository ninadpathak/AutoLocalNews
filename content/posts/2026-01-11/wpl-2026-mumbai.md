> **TLDR**: The Women's Premier League 2026 is coming to DY Patil Stadium. Get ready for cricket and traffic chaos.

The DY Patil Stadium in Nerul is prepping to host WPL 2026. Forget about potholes; now we're worrying about parking.

Remember the last time a big match was here? Absolute pandemonium near the Belapur flyover. Expect the same, but with more glitter.

So, what can you expect? Stats! Records! Cricket! The Sportstar article breaks down all you need to know – if you care about that sort of thing. More importantly, plan your routes carefully. Maybe just stay home and order pizza.

Consider yourself warned. If you live anywhere near Sector 3, lock your doors. The WPL is coming.
