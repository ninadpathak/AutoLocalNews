> **TLDR**: Mumbai Indians Women (MI) face Delhi Capitals Women (DC) at DY Patil Stadium. Expect runs; the pitch is a belter.

Another Women's Premier League (WPL) showdown descends on our very own DY Patil Stadium. Forget your Sunday plans; this is where the action is. MI Women are locking horns with DC Women, and frankly, we're expecting fireworks.

Word on the street (and from *Business Standard*, apparently) is that the pitch is primed for batting. Translation: sixes galore. DY Patil is known for its pace and bounce. Bowlers, good luck. You'll need it.

Key stats? Who cares! Just kidding (sort of). Expect a high-scoring affair. Maybe someone will finally park one on the Seawoods Grand Central complex. Now *that* would be a headline.

Tickets are still available, maybe. If you can brave the Seawoods traffic, get down there. Otherwise, find a TV and prepare for some serious hitting. Just don't blame us if your neighbor complains about your cheering.
