> **TLDR**: The Navi Mumbai Metro's Pendhar to Central Park line aced its trial run. Maybe we'll actually get to use this thing someday.

The Navi Mumbai Metro just took a big step – a successful trial run from Pendhar to Central Park! CIDCO finally gave the green light after what feels like a decade of delays.

The test zipped along the 11-km stretch on Line 1, hitting stations in Sectors 11, 34, and 21. No word yet on when *actual* service will start, but this is progress, right?

Remember when they said it would be running by 2020? Yeah, us too. Let's hope this test run means we're closer to dodging those insane Panvel-bound bus queues.

CIDCO is probably patting themselves on the back. We'll be impressed when we can actually use it to get somewhere.
