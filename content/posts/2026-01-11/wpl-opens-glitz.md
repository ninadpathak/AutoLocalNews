> **TLDR**: WPL 2026 launched with a star-studded show in Navi Mumbai. Because nothing says 'cricket' like Yo Yo Honey Singh.

The DY Patil Stadium became ground zero for Bollywood flash last night. Jacqueline Fernandez and Yo Yo Honey Singh kicked off the Women's Premier League 2026 opening ceremony. Forget sixes; we got dance moves and questionable lyrics instead.

Sources report deafening cheers (and probable tinnitus) as Honey Singh belted out his hits. Fernandez, channeling peak glamour, led a dance spectacle that briefly distracted from the stadium's questionable acoustics. The whole thing was reportedly livestreamed, meaning the rest of India got to share in the sensory overload.

Wardwizard Group, you know, the e-vehicle people from Vashi, are "presenting partners". Expect a barrage of electric scooter ads between overs. The actual cricket started later, but let's be real, the real action was off-field. Wonder if Hardik Pandya was taking notes?
