> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai police officer vanishes, leaving behind a letter alleging corruption. Wife reports him missing, adding fuel to the fire in Sector 17.

The NMMC police force is dealing with a full-blown crisis this week. An officer from Sector 17 has gone AWOL, but not before allegedly penning a letter accusing a senior officer of shady dealings. According to the wife, she filed a missing person report when he didn't return home from duty. Inside the report, she mentioned the letter, making it public. Now, the department is scrambling to contain the fallout. 

The letter, contents of which are still unverified, details specific instances of alleged bribery and extortion within the upper ranks. The missing officer names names, including a Deputy Commissioner. If true, this could trigger a major shakeup at Belapur HQ. An internal investigation has been launched. 

Opposition leaders are already calling for an independent inquiry, predictably grandstanding outside the police station. As of now, the focus remains on locating the missing officer. Did he run? Was he silenced? Or is this one elaborate hoax? Either way, the NMMC police have a major PR nightmare on their hands.
