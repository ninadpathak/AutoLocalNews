> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai police officer is missing after a letter accusing a senior officer of corruption surfaced. This whole thing is messier than Kharghar during peak hour.

The Navi Mumbai police force has a mystery on its hands, and it stinks worse than Panvel during low tide. A police officer from the city has vanished, leaving behind a letter that names names and accuses a senior official of shady dealings.

The missing cop's wife has already filed a complaint. The letter, purportedly written by the missing officer, details alleged corruption within the ranks. Think backhanders, dodgy deals, the whole nine yards.

The letter specifically calls out a senior officer within the NMMC area. The contents allege a pattern of corrupt practices. The police are saying they're investigating, but let's be real, this could get ugly. The investigation is currently focused on verifying the letter's authenticity.

Meanwhile, a search party is combing the area near the officer’s last known location. This whole saga sounds like something straight out of a bad Bollywood movie. Only this time, it's playing out in the concrete jungle of Navi Mumbai.
