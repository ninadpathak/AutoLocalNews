> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai police officer is missing after a letter surfaced accusing a senior official of corruption. His wife has filed a complaint; this could get messy.

The Navi Mumbai police force has a mystery on its hands: one of their own is gone. A police naik (constable), posted in the security department, disappeared this week, leaving behind a letter alleging corruption by a senior officer.

The letter, now in the hands of the Raigad police, doesn't mince words. It details specific instances of alleged bribery and abuse of power. The missing officer's wife has filed a formal complaint, demanding a thorough investigation into both her husband's disappearance and the claims made in the letter.

Details are scant, but sources whisper about a possible internal inquiry already underway. If the accusations are true, expect a major shakeup at police HQ in Belapur. This could be bigger than just one missing cop.
