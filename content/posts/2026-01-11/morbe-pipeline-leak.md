> **TLDR**: A leaky pipe from the Morbe Dam hit Navi Mumbai's water supply. Brace yourselves, folks – it's going to be a dry few days, and the NMMC better have a good explanation.

Another week, another infrastructure failure. This time, it's the Morbe Dam pipeline that's decided to give up the ghost, leaving taps across Navi Mumbai running drier than the Kharghar hills in summer. 

The NMMC reported the leak yesterday, blaming it on 'wear and tear' – a suspiciously vague excuse for a city supposedly planning a ₹17,000 crore infrastructure upgrade.

Large swathes of the city are affected. Sectors 1 through 30 in Vashi, along with chunks of Sanpada, Nerul, and even Seawoods are reporting drastically reduced water pressure. Expect your morning showers to feel more like a polite drizzle. 

The official line? Supply will 'normalize' by January 10th. That's code for "we're scrambling, and you might want to stock up on bottled water."

Meanwhile, residents are taking to social media to share tips for surviving the drought, including showering at the gym and collecting rainwater. Necessity, as they say, is the mother of desperately creative hydration solutions. Let's hope the NMMC fixes this soon, before things get *really* thirsty.
