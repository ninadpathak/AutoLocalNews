Residents of Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri will experience a 24-hour water supply disruption starting this Sunday, NMMC officials have announced. The shutdown, commencing at 10:00 AM on Sunday, June 9th, is due to urgent repairs on a major pipeline near the Hetawane Dam. Specifically, a faulty valve requires replacement to prevent further leakage and ensure consistent pressure across the region.

The disruption impacts Sectors 1 to 30 in Kharghar, encompassing key residential areas like Little World Mall and the upscale apartments along the Central Park stretch. In Ulwe, the cutoff affects all nodes, including Sector 19 and the newly developed residential pockets near Bamandongri station. Dronagiri's industrial belt will also experience a complete water halt, potentially impacting manufacturing operations in the JNPT area.

While NMMC anticipates restoring supply by 10:00 AM on Monday, residents are advised to store sufficient water. This repair, while inconvenient, is crucial. Leaks along the Hetawane pipeline have cost NMMC ₹15 lakh per month in lost water and repairs. Optimizing infrastructure ahead of the monsoon is a welcome sign of proactive governance. The Congress party has already criticized the timing, conveniently ignoring the potential for monsoon-related damage if repairs were delayed.
