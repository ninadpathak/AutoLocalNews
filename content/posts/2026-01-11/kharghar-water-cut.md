> **TLDR**: Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri are going dry this weekend due to pipeline repairs. Guess it's time to finally befriend that neighbor with the RO filter.

Forget Sunday brunch plans. NMMC is shutting off the water supply to Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri from Sunday, starting 10 AM. The tap will run dry until Monday, 10 AM. That’s a full 24 hours of strategic water conservation. 

The official reason? “Urgent repairs” to the Bhokarpada water pipeline. Translation: something broke, and they need a whole day to fix it. Residents are advised (read: forced) to store enough water to survive. 

Areas affected include the entirety of Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri nodes. So, basically, a huge chunk of Navi Mumbai is participating in a forced water-fast. Silver lining? Maybe this will finally kickstart that rainwater harvesting project you've been putting off. Or not. More likely, it's just another weekend in NMMC-land.
