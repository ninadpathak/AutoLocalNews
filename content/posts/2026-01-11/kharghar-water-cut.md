> **TLDR**: Water supply is cut off in Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri this Sunday. Guess it's time to finally visit that weird water park in Belapur. 

Planning on showering this Sunday? You might want to rethink that. NMMC has announced a water supply shutdown affecting Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri nodes. 

The disruption kicks in at 10:00 AM on Sunday, June 9th, and is expected to last until 10:00 AM on Monday, June 10th. Blame the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) for scheduled maintenance work on the Hetawane Dam pipeline. 

Areas affected include: entire Kharghar node (Sectors 1 to 47), Ulwe node, and Dronagiri node. Residents are advised to store sufficient water beforehand. Or, you know, just embrace the grime. 

So, while the MJP fixes its pipes, residents are left to contemplate the joys of water conservation. Maybe it's a good time to finally try that 'dry shampoo' everyone's been talking about.
