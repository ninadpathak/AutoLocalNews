Residents in Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri nodes brace for water supply disruptions starting this Sunday. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) announced planned maintenance impacting the Hetawane dam pipeline.

The shutdown begins at 10:00 AM on Sunday, July 7th, and stretches until 10:00 AM on Monday, July 8th. Water supply will be completely suspended during this period, CIDCO officials confirmed. Residents are advised to store sufficient water in advance. 

The maintenance aims to ensure reliable long-term water supply to the rapidly expanding nodes. CIDCO has invested heavily in upgrading the water infrastructure. The disruption is a short-term inconvenience for a long-term gain.
