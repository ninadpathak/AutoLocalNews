Members of the Bajrang Dal staged a protest outside a clothing showroom in Vashi Sector 17 yesterday, objecting to the imagery in the brand's latest advertising campaign. The group, numbering approximately 50 individuals, gathered outside the Soch showroom at the Inorbit Mall vicinity around 4 PM, chanting slogans and demanding the removal of what they deemed "offensive" content. 

The advertisement in question, prominently displayed above the store entrance, features a woman in traditional attire that the Bajrang Dal alleges is a misrepresentation of Hindu cultural values. According to sources within the group, the imagery "insensitively commercializes sacred symbols." No formal complaint was filed with the Vashi police, but officers were present to maintain order and prevent any escalation.

This incident underscores the increasing sensitivity surrounding perceived cultural appropriation in advertising. While the right to protest is constitutionally protected, the incident also raises questions about the balance between creative expression and the potential for causing offense, particularly in the lead-up to the Ganpati festival. The Soch showroom management declined to comment on the protest, but sources suggest the company is reviewing the advertising campaign in light of the concerns raised. This is not the first time right-wing Hindu groups have protested commercial and film content in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. Previous incidents include objections to advertisements for fairness creams and condom brands that did not suit their values. This event brings into question the content regulatory framework within Navi Mumbai, and whether or not advertisements should be vetted before being put up.
