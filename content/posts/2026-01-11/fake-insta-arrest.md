> **TLDR**: A Vashi creep made a fake Insta account of a teen and posted nasty stuff. Cops caught him, proving the internet isn't as anonymous as losers think.

The internet got a little less anonymous this week after Vashi police busted a guy for creating a fake Instagram account and posting obscene content of a teenage girl. Think twice before you be a jerk online, kids.

The accused, a 23-year-old from Sector 17, allegedly swiped photos of the victim from her real account and created a doppelganger profile filled with, shall we say, *unflattering* material. The victim, understandably freaked, reported it to the cops.

The Vashi cybercrime unit, probably fueled by chai and righteous anger, tracked the digital dirtbag down. He's now cooling his heels in police custody, facing charges under the IT Act. The NMMC should put up a billboard of his face as a warning.

Let this be a lesson: Navi Mumbai's cops aren't messing around when it comes to online creeps. Delete your burner accounts, folks. They're watching.
