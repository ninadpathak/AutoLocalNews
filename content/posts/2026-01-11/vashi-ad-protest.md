> **TLDR**: Right-wing group protested outside a clothing store in Vashi over an allegedly offensive ad. The vibes were definitely not chill.

A gaggle of saffron-clad activists from some pro-Hindu group (who can keep track anymore?) descended on a clothing showroom in Vashi Sector 17 this afternoon. Their beef? Apparently, an advertisement offended their delicate sensibilities.

The advertisement, plastered across the store's front window like it was trying to sell clothes, featured something they deemed anti-Hindu. Details are hazy, because who actually reads ads? But let's just say chanting ensued. Loudly.

For two hours, the air around the usually sterile Sector 17 mall vibrated with the sounds of the Hanuman Chalisa. Shoppers paused, confused, wondering if they’d accidentally stumbled onto a religious flash mob. Police showed up (eventually) and managed to keep the chanting contained to the sidewalk.

No arrests were made. The showroom manager, looking deeply stressed, promised to “look into the matter.” One wonders if this means the ad will be quietly taken down, or if Vashi will become the next battleground in the culture wars. Either way, retail therapy just got a whole lot more interesting.
