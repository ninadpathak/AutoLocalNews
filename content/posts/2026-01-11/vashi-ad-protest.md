A demonstration erupted outside a clothing store in Vashi Sector 17 yesterday afternoon. Members of a local Hindu organization alleged that the store's advertisement was offensive to their religious sentiments. The protest caused a brief disruption to traffic near the station. 

Demonstrators gathered around 3 PM, chanting slogans and demanding the removal of the advertisement. Police arrived on the scene and managed to contain the protest. No arrests were made. 

The contentious ad featured a model wearing attire that the group deemed disrespectful to Hindu traditions. The showroom management has yet to issue a statement. The incident highlights the growing sensitivity surrounding religious expression in the city.
