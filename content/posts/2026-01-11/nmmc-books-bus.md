> **TLDR**: NMMC launched mini-libraries at bus stops. Finally, something to do besides stare blankly at the Panvel bus.

Tired of doomscrolling while waiting for the 520 to Nerul? The NMMC has a solution that doesn't involve more screen time: books. Small, open-air libraries have popped up at bus shelters across the city.

Think of it as a literary pit stop. The initiative, costing ₹10 lakh, stocks each location with a rotating collection of novels, magazines, and comics. Sector 17 Vashi and the CBD Belapur bus depot are among the first locations to get the upgrade. Someone in the NMMC actually had a good idea, for once.

Early reactions are mixed. Some commuters are thrilled, others are skeptical about how long the books will last before disappearing. Either way, it's better than another ad for hair implants.

Will this solve Navi Mumbai's traffic woes? Nope. Will it give you something to do while you're stuck waiting? Maybe. Just don't forget to return the book, unless you want to be THAT person.
