> **TLDR**: The WPL 2026 opening ceremony at the DY Patil Stadium will feature Honey Singh, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Harnaaz Sandhu. Forget cricket, this is *the* BollyWood Premier League.

DY Patil Stadium is about to get a whole lot louder. Forget sixes, expect *dhamaal*. The WPL 2026 opening ceremony is ditching the traditional sports fanfare and going straight for Bollywood razzle-dazzle.

Honey Singh, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Harnaaz Sandhu are confirmed to headline the pre-match entertainment. This isn't just a warm-up; it's a full-blown concert before the first ball is even bowled.

While some purists might clutch their pearls, others are already queuing up for selfies. Will the stadium survive the sheer volume of glitter and bass? Maybe. Will it be entertaining? Almost definitely.

Gate opens at 6 PM. Expect traffic on the Thane-Belapur road to be a solid snarl from, oh, about 4 PM onwards. Maybe the real entertainment is getting there.
