> **TLDR**: ₹16.16 lakh in unaccounted cash was found in a Vashi Mercedes during election season. Looks like someone's playing Monopoly for real this time.

Election season in Navi Mumbai is getting interesting. A Mercedes-Benz in Vashi was found carrying ₹16.16 lakh in unmarked bills. Because nothing says "grassroots campaign" like a German luxury car.

The cash was discovered during a routine check near sector 17. Police are trying to figure out who the cash belonged to, and where it was headed. Our guess? Straight into someone's campaign fund. 

Political parties are remaining quiet. No one wants to claim responsibility for the stash. The investigation is ongoing, but we all know how these things usually go. Expect a lot of finger-pointing and very little actual accountability.

Meanwhile, the NMMC election just got a whole lot more expensive. Maybe they should just auction off the car to pay for potholes. Whoever loses gets to ride the NMMT bus for the next 5 years.
