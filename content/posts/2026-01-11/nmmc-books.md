> **TLDR**: NMMC launched mini-libraries at bus stops so you can read while waiting. Finally, something actually useful from the NMMC.

Forget doom-scrolling on Instagram. Now you can pretend to be cultured while waiting for the 520 from Kharghar at Sector 14. The NMMC installed mini-libraries at bus shelters across the city this week.

Shelters now stock everything from Chetan Bhagat to, allegedly, some actual literature. The idea is simple: grab a book, read it, return it, or swap it for another. Think of it as a book buffet, minus the questionable hygiene.

Whether this will survive the monsoon, or the sticky fingers of bored teenagers, remains to be seen. Still, credit where it's due: maybe, just maybe, someone will discover a love for reading instead of Candy Crush. Free books are in bus stops across Navi Mumbai.
