> **TLDR**: Politicians are blasting music and setting off fireworks for the election, despite the already terrible air quality. Are they actually trying to make us hate them?

The election season's here, and with it, the return of the politicians' favorite hobby: annoying everyone. According to a Reddit post on r/NaviMumbai, the politicians are not just blasting music, but setting off firecrackers too. This is happening despite the fact that the AQI is already garbage.

Is it any wonder why people hate politicians? The combination of deafening music and toxic fumes is a masterclass in how to irritate an entire city. Residents in Kharghar Sector 34 and Nerul Sector 21 reported sleepless nights thanks to the noise. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board is probably taking a nap.

Seriously, do these guys even live here? Or are they actively trying to make the city uninhabitable before the next election cycle? At least give us some earplugs with the voting slips.
