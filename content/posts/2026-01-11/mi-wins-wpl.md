> **TLDR**: Mumbai Indians crushed Delhi Capitals by 50 runs in the WPL final. Another trophy for MI – guess Ambani's still smiling.

The Mumbai Indians defended their WPL crown in style, thrashing the Delhi Capitals by 50 runs at the DY Patil Stadium last night. DC, chasing 165, crumbled under pressure, managing a paltry 113 all out.

MI's batting lineup fired, with Harmanpreet Kaur leading the charge with a quickfire 45. Sector 15, CBD Belapur erupted in celebration as the final wicket fell.

The Capitals' top order imploded early, with star batter Shafali Verma getting out for a duck. Their middle order offered little resistance against MI's relentless bowling attack.

The victory parade will likely snarl traffic along the Sion-Panvel highway today. Expect delays near Kharghar and Nerul. Guess it's back to work tomorrow, Navi Mumbai – unless you're on the MI payroll.
