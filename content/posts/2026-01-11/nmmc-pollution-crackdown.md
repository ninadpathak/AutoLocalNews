> **TLDR**: NMMC stopped work at 19 construction sites for flouting pollution rules. Turns out, Navi Mumbai's developers aren't as 'eco-friendly' as their brochures suggest.

Dust chokes Ghansoli. Concrete mixers roar in Nerul. NMMC finally noticed, hitting 19 construction sites with stop-work notices. And get this: a whopping ₹43.25 lakh in fines levied against 173 developers. Because apparently, rules are just suggestions now.

According to NMMC babus, these sites weren't following dust control norms. We're talking uncovered construction, blatant disregard for debris disposal, and a general 'who cares?' attitude towards air quality. Sector 15 in CBD Belapur and the Kharghar node are repeat offenders, sources say.

"We're serious about this," claims a press release nobody will read. "Developers need to pull up their socks." Meanwhile, residents of Seawoods continue to cough up a lung every morning. Maybe try, I don't know, *actually* enforcing the rules?

Next time you see a cloud of construction dust billowing over the city, remember that ₹43.25 lakh figure. It's the price of clean air... or rather, the price developers are willing to pay to pollute it.
