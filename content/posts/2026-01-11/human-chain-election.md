> **TLDR**: Over a thousand students linked arms to promote voting in the 2026 NMMC elections. Considering youth apathy, will this stunt actually work, or is it just another photo op?

Mid-day breathlessly reported that 1100 students formed a human chain this week. The goal? To raise awareness for the upcoming Navi Mumbai civic elections.

The chain stretched from the Nerul LP signal all the way to the DY Patil stadium. Seriously, who signed off on this? A human chain? In 2026?

These kids probably have better things to do than hold hands for democracy. Like, doom scrolling or figuring out how to pay rent. But hey, at least someone's trying, right?

Here's hoping this bizarre display of civic engagement translates into actual votes. Otherwise, it's just another Tuesday in NMMC – a whole lot of effort for absolutely zero measurable impact.

NMMC officials were unavailable for comment, probably because they were too busy patting themselves on the back.
