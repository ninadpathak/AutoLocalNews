> **TLDR**: Gujarat Giants defeated UP Warriorz by 10 runs in the opening match of WPL 2026 at the DY Patil Stadium. This victory proves that maybe, just maybe, the next WPL season won't be a total snooze-fest.

Navi Mumbai witnessed a nail-biting start to the Women's Premier League 2026 as the Gujarat Giants edged out the UP Warriorz. The Giants posted a respectable 162, then strangled the Warriorz' chase with tight bowling in the death overs.

The DY Patil Stadium crowd was on its feet as the Warriorz needed 15 off the last over. But the Giants' bowler, Fatima Khan, held her nerve. She conceded only four runs, sealing a 10-run victory.

"Our fielding was trash, to be honest," said Giants captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, after the match (probably). "But hey, a win is a win!"

Deepti Sharma's valiant 61 for the Warriorz ultimately went in vain. Local spectators from Nerul and Seawoods who braved the traffic to get to the stadium were treated to an exciting game. Whether they thought it was worth the ₹300 ticket is another question entirely.

With the win, the Giants have set the early pace in the WPL 2026. They showed that this season might actually have some surprises in store. Let's hope the pitches are better than the ones at the Kharghar T20 tournament.
