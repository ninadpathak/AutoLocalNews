> **TLDR**: NMMC election squad found ₹16 lakh in an APMC trader's Mercedes. Looks like someone forgot that election season means *extra* scrutiny. 

Election season's heating up, and so is the NMMC's vigilance. Yesterday, their flying squad intercepted a Mercedes-Benz near the APMC market, Sector 19, Vashi. Inside? A cool ₹16 lakh in cash, allegedly belonging to an unnamed APMC trader.

The cash was discovered during a routine check. The trader couldn't provide a convincing explanation for the hefty sum, officials said. Now, the Income Tax department is involved. Expect some uncomfortable questions.

The seizure raises eyebrows about potential violations of the election code of conduct. Was this money intended to sway voters? Or just really bad financial planning? The investigation continues. Either way, someone's having a bad week.
