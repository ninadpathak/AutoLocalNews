> **TLDR**: NMMC election squad nabbed ₹16 lakh in cash from an APMC trader's Mercedes. Looks like someone forgot campaign finance rules exist (or thought they were optional).

Election season in Navi Mumbai just got a little more interesting. An NMMC flying squad intercepted a Mercedes-Benz near the APMC market in Vashi yesterday. Inside? A cool ₹16 lakh in unmarked cash, according to officials.

The trader, whose name is being withheld pending further investigation, couldn't explain where the money came from, police say. Maybe he was planning a really epic Diwali party? Or perhaps a down payment on another Benz?

The cash is now in the custody of the election commission. The NMMC is investigating possible violations of the election code of conduct. Expect more drama as the election heats up. This might just be the beginning.
