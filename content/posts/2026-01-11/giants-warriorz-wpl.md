> **TLDR**: Gujarat Giants won their first WPL match against UP Warriorz by 10 runs in a thriller. The vibe at the DY Patil was electric, even if the actual cricket was occasionally… chaotic.

The Women's Premier League 2026 exploded into action at the DY Patil Stadium last night. The Gujarat Giants clawed their way to a 10-run victory over the UP Warriorz, and the crowd went wild.

Chasing 163, the Warriorz stumbled. Sector 5 residents probably heard the collective groan as Grace Harris was caught out in the 18th over.

The Giants' bowlers held their nerve, snatching wickets and strangling the Warriorz' scoring. Even the questionable umpiring couldn't save the Warriorz.

Earlier, the Giants' innings was a rollercoaster. A shaky start was rescued by a blistering knock from [insert player name here]. The final total of 162 felt just enough.

For Navi Mumbai, the WPL is more than just cricket. It's a chance to see world-class sport right here. Just try getting a rickshaw near the stadium now. ₹300 minimum, guaranteed.
