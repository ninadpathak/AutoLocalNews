> **TLDR**: Over 1,100 Koparkhairane students created a human chain to promote voter awareness. Honestly, if kids can do this, adults have no excuse not to vote.

Koparkhairane saw a heartwarming display of civic responsibility this week, with students, teachers, and parents joining hands (literally) for voter awareness. Forget rallies; these kids are doing it right.

The human chain, organized under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) program, snaked through the heart of Koparkhairane village. NMMC Schools No. 36 and 122 led the charge, proving that Sector 14's students know what's up.

Imagine trying to coordinate 1,100 kids. The organizational effort alone deserves a national award. Let's hope this enthusiasm translates into packed polling booths on election day. Now, THAT would be a sight.
