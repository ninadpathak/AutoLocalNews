> **TLDR**: A BJP candidate in Navi Mumbai got a last-minute reprieve from the High Court, halting the election in his ward. Is this justice, or just another Tuesday in Indian politics?

The High Court slammed the brakes on the election in Ward 12, Koparkhairane, giving BJP nominee, Kishore Patkar, an interim stay. Seems someone cried foul about the NMMC's rejection of Patkar's nomination papers.

Patkar argued that the rejection was bogus. Now, the HC has suspended the election process pending further review. The election was supposed to happen *today*, but now… who knows?

Ward 12 residents are probably thrilled. Or maybe they're just confused. Either way, democracy in Sector 12 just got a whole lot more complicated.

This isn't the first time Navi Mumbai's election process has resembled a Bollywood plot. Stay tuned, folks. The next twist is probably just around the corner.
