> **TLDR**: Three thieves are in NMMC lockup after a Vashi bust. Police recovered stolen jewellery and appliances – a bad day for crime, a good day for justice (finally!).

The Vashi police station just notched a win. Three individuals are cooling their heels after getting pinched for a string of thefts across the node. Forget cat burglars, these guys were hitting houses and making off with anything they could carry.

Acting on a tip-off, the cops swooped in near sector 17 and recovered a haul of stolen goods. We're talking gold chains, ₹50,000 worth of silverware, and enough blenders to open a juice bar.

The accused are currently helping police with inquiries, potentially linking them to other unsolved cases in the area. Maybe now residents of sector 14, 15, and 16 can finally sleep soundly, knowing their precious mixer-grinders are safe... for now.
