> **TLDR**: Eighteen students at a Nerul school tested positive for COVID-19. Remember when we thought we were done with this? Yeah, us too.

Chaos at a Nerul school today after eighteen students tested positive for COVID-19. Parents are, understandably, freaking out. The school, located in Sector 21, is now a containment zone. 

The news broke this morning after a routine check-up revealed the cluster. NMMC health officials are on-site, scrambling to trace contacts and contain the spread. Expect long queues at testing centers near you. 

Is this the start of another wave? Unlikely, but who knows anymore? Remember those masks you shoved in a drawer? Time to dig them out. And maybe stock up on Maggi, just in case.
