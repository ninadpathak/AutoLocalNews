> **TLDR**: Two women who feed stray dogs in Navi Mumbai got booked for asking the NMMC why they were snatching dogs. Turns out, even good Samaritans aren't safe from bureaucracy around here.

Trouble is brewing between dog feeders and the NMMC. Two women in Navi Mumbai are facing charges after questioning the NMMC's dog-catching practices. The incident blew up after the women challenged the NMMC team during a recent pick-up operation in their area.

According to the *Times of India*, the feeders voiced concerns about the welfare of the dogs. Specifically, they wanted to know where the dogs were being taken. The NMMC, apparently, did not appreciate the questions. 

The NMMC filed a complaint. Now, these women are battling charges for… asking questions. 

The charges highlight the ongoing tension between animal lovers and the NMMC. For residents, it's a reminder that even well-intentioned actions can land you in bureaucratic hot water. Next time you see a dog, maybe just keep walking.
