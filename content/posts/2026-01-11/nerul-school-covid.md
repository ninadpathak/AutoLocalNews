Eighteen students at a private school in Sector 21, Nerul, tested positive for Covid-19 this week, prompting a temporary closure of the campus. The incident, confirmed by NMMC health officials, marks a localized resurgence of the virus following months of relative calm across the satellite city.

The initial case was detected in a Class VIII student during routine screening on Monday. Subsequent testing revealed a cluster of infections concentrated primarily within two classrooms. While all affected students are reportedly exhibiting mild symptoms, the NMMC has initiated contact tracing and containment measures, including disinfection of the school premises.

The school's administration, adhering to NMMC guidelines, has suspended in-person classes for a period of seven days. Online learning will resume to minimize disruption to the academic calendar. The incident serves as a reminder that, despite widespread vaccination, pockets of vulnerability remain, particularly within densely populated environments like school settings. This outbreak may intensify calls from some quarters for a return to mandatory masking in educational institutions.
