> **TLDR**: BJP says Congress is against the Ladki Bahin Yojana. Because apparently helping girls is now a political stance? 

Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Maharashtra Revenue Minister, is not happy. He's accusing Congress of opposing the Ladki Bahin Yojana, a welfare scheme launched in 2024. According to Bawankule, talking about helping girls isn't against election rules. The municipal corporation elections are January 15th, so naturally, everyone's yelling about everything.

Bawankule told reporters that the scheme, which provides financial assistance to young women, isn't a violation of the Model Code of Conduct. He didn't specify which exact part of the code Congress thinks is being broken, which is annoying. He really just said it during a press conference.

So, is this real concern, or just election season theatrics? Place your bets now. Because whatever the truth is, someone is definitely playing politics with women’s welfare.
