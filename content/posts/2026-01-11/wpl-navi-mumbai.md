> **TLDR**: Women's Premier League hits Navi Mumbai today. Get ready for roaring crowds and overpriced snacks. 

Get ready, cricket fans! The Women's Premier League has officially landed in our backyard. The first match kicks off today, January 10, 2026, right here in Navi Mumbai.

Expect traffic jams stretching back to Belapur. The NMMC better have extra garbage trucks on standby for all those empty chip packets. Forget parking anywhere near the stadium; your best bet is the rickshaw mafia outside Nerul station.

Sources whisper (okay, they shouted it across the tea stall) that ticket scalpers are already out in force. Expect to pay double, maybe triple, for a decent seat. Is it worth it? That depends on how badly you need to see some sixes.

So, grab your face paint, practice your chants, and brace yourselves. WPL is here. Let the games begin – and may the best team (with the loudest fans) win! And don’t forget your wallets – you’ll need them.
