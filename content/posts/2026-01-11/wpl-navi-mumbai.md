> **TLDR**: Women's Premier League match in Navi Mumbai on Jan 10, 2026. Finally, something to do in January besides complain about the cold.

The Women's Premier League is bringing the heat to Navi Mumbai! Forget your winter blues; the 3rd match (N) is set to ignite the city on January 10, 2026.

ESPN India is your hookup for all the action. Details are still trickling in, but expect packed stands and plenty of sixes at the Navi Mumbai venue. Hopefully that venue is not the DY Patil, because it is a structural nightmare.

Will this match finally give Kharghar residents something to brag about other than their proximity to the Central Park? Maybe. Will Sector 12 aunties be discussing batting averages over their evening chai? Probably not, but a guy can dream. Time to dust off your jerseys and pick a side. This ain't your grandma's cricket match (unless your grandma is Mithali Raj).
