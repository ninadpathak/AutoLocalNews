> **TLDR**: BJP and Shiv Sena are fighting hard in the Ambernath and Navi Mumbai civic polls. Expect fireworks and maybe a few flying chairs, because that's just how things roll here.

The civic election season just got a whole lot spicier. The BJP and Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) are locked in a proper rumble, especially in Ambernath and spilling over into Navi Mumbai.

What's the beef? It's all about claiming dominance, setting the stage for bigger electoral showdowns. The BJP wants to prove it's the boss of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), while the Shinde Sena is desperate to show it still has juice after the split.

In Ambernath, expect some seriously aggressive campaigning. Each side is throwing everything they've got – rallies, roadshows, and probably some good old-fashioned mudslinging. Word on the street is that this battle will directly impact how things shake out in Navi Mumbai, especially in places like Airoli and Ghansoli.

So, keep your eyes peeled. This isn't just about local councilors. It's a power struggle with implications for the whole region. Forget your daily dose of *saas-bahu*. This is real drama, folks.
