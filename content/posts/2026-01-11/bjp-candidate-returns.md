> **TLDR**: A BJP candidate, Sandeep Thakur, is back in the NMMC election race after the High Court overturned his disqualification. Did someone say 'election drama'?

The HC threw out the NMMC's decision to disqualify Sandeep Thakur, BJP candidate from Ward 76 (Turbhe). Thakur's nomination was initially rejected over some paperwork issue – surprise, surprise.

Turns out, the NMMC messed up. The court said the election officer didn't give Thakur a fair chance to explain. Basically, bureaucracy at its finest.

So, what now? Thakur's back in the game. He will be competing for a seat in the upcoming Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation election. The BJP is probably doing a little victory dance right about now. Whether this "restoration" will actually translate into votes is the ₹64,000 question (that's ₹6.4 million for those under 30).
