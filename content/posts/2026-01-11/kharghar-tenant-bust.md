> **TLDR**: Cops raided Kharghar apartments, snagging illegal foreign nationals. Landlords are in deep trouble, facing charges for renting to them.

Kharghar landlords are about to learn a very expensive lesson: check your tenant's paperwork. Last night's NMMC raid, spearheaded by the Kharghar police, netted several foreign nationals residing illegally in the area.

The swoop, focused on Sector 35 and Sector 12, resulted in multiple detentions. Police sources confirmed that property owners now face charges under the Foreigners Act for failing to verify tenant documentation.

"We are cracking down on illegal residency," stated Senior Inspector Raju Adagale this morning. "Landlords have a responsibility. Ignorance isn't a defense when national security is at stake."

Expect more raids. And if you're a landlord in Kharghar? Dust off those tenant agreements and hope everything's in order. Because ₹5,000 fine is nothing compared to the legal hassle coming your way if it's not.
