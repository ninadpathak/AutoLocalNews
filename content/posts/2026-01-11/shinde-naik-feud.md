> **TLDR**: CM Shinde says Navi Mumbai needs change, threatens development funds. Naik claps back, warning Shinde not to underestimate him.

Naik and Shinde are throwing shade, and Navi Mumbai is caught in the crossfire. At a function in Airoli, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde declared that Navi Mumbai *needs change*. Translation? He's not thrilled with the current NCP leadership.

Shinde, never one to mince words, hinted that development funds could be withheld if things don't improve. Because nothing motivates like a financial threat. He specifically called out lapses in CIDCO projects and infrastructure snags. Ouch.

Not one to back down, Ganesh Naik fired back. He warned Shinde not to underestimate his influence. He reminded everyone of his long history in Navi Mumbai politics. The political temperature in Navi Mumbai? Officially simmering.

Naik questioned Shinde's sudden interest in the city. He suggested Shinde focus on fixing problems elsewhere. The event was a clash of egos and political maneuvering. Navi Mumbai just got front-row seats to a power struggle. Buckle up.
