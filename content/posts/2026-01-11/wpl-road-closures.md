> **TLDR**: Roads near DY Patil Stadium are closed until January 17 for the Women's Premier League. Hope you like detours, because you're about to become an expert.

Heads up, folks! If your daily commute involves navigating the concrete jungle around DY Patil Stadium in Nerul, prepare for some detours. Thanks to the WPL 2026 shenanigans, certain roads are now off-limits until January 17.

According to Mumbai Live, the closures are in full effect to manage traffic and security during the matches. We're talking about a vehicle ban on the stretch near the stadium. So, that shortcut you love? Gone. Consider it an involuntary vacation.

Which roads exactly? Well, "these roads," according to the original article, which is less than helpful. Expect closures and diversions near Sector 7, Sector 9, and the Belpada area. Basically, if you see a barricade and a bored-looking cop, you're in the zone.

Alternative routes? Good luck with that. Just kidding (sort of). Try the Shilphata-Mahape Road if you're coming from Thane, or maybe just stay home and order pizza. Your call. Just don't say we didn't warn you.

Consider this your official heads-up: plan ahead, pack your patience, and maybe download a white noise app to drown out the honking. Remember, it's all for the WPL. Or something.
