> **TLDR**: A pro-Hindu group protested an ad outside a clothing store in Vashi. They think it's disrespectful to Hinduism; the brand is staying quiet, probably hoping it blows over.

The Hanuman Sena showed up outside a clothing store in Vashi Sector 17 yesterday, and they weren't there to shop. The problem? A promotional image they're calling offensive to Hindu beliefs. The ad features, according to Sena members, imagery that clashes with their religious views. They want it GONE. 

Brand officials aren't talking. So far, the posters remain in place. The Sena folks threatened more action if the ads aren't removed ASAP. Expect more chanting, apparently. 

Is it really offensive, or just a slow news day for the Sena? Either way, the brand is learning the hard way that everything is political, even fast fashion.
