> **TLDR**: 18 students at a Nerul school tested positive for COVID-19, raising concerns about a new wave. Remember when we thought 2020 was over? Good times.

Panic at Ryan International School in Nerul after nearly twenty students caught COVID. Parents are scrambling, and attendance numbers look set to plummet faster than the monsoon drains overflow.

The outbreak occurred in Sector 21. Contact tracing is underway, according to NMMC officials, who are probably wishing they'd chosen a different career. The school has been temporarily shut down for sanitization.

This cluster comes amidst rising cases across Maharashtra, prompting renewed calls for mask mandates. Because nothing says freedom like a piece of cloth over your face... at least it keeps the pollution out.

Will this become a full-blown wave? Hard to say. But one thing's for sure: hand sanitizer sales are about to skyrocket in Vashi's D-Mart.
