> **TLDR**: Eighteen students at a Nerul school tested positive for COVID-19. Guess those masks weren't optional after all. 

Panic at the podium. Eighteen students at a Nerul school are down with COVID. The news broke late yesterday after a routine check at the Ryan International School in Sector 44. 

The NMMC health department scrambled to contain the outbreak. Parents received frantic calls and directives to keep their kids home. Contact tracing is underway, focusing on classmates and teachers who might have been exposed. Expect long queues at testing centers.

What's next? Sanitization drives and worried WhatsApp groups are already spreading faster than the virus. The school remains open, but attendance is a ghost town. Maybe this will finally get people to take this seriously again. Or not.
