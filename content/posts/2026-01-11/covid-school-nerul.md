> **TLDR**: 18 students at a Nerul school test positive for COVID. Back to masks and hand sanitizer, folks; the pandemic's encore is here.

The scene at Ryan International School, Nerul, is a bit of a mess today after a cluster of COVID cases emerged, sending parents into a frenzy. Eighteen students have tested positive, prompting the school to implement immediate safety measures. Sector 45 aunties are not happy.

While NMMC health officials are downplaying the situation, parents are scrambling. Contact tracing is underway, and those infected have been advised to isolate. Online classes may be making a comeback. No one wants a repeat of 2020.

The school administration is sanitizing like mad and preaching vigilance, but the virus is a persistent nightmare. Time to dig out those masks and embrace the elbow bump. Consider this your cue to avoid the buffet line at Sunday brunch. Are we *really* surprised though?
