> **TLDR**: A Panvel woman got scammed out of ₹45 lakh by believing a fake customs demand. Turns out, online "gifts" are just a great way to lose your life savings.

Another day, another ludicrous online scam. This time, a Panvel resident got played for ₹45.91 lakh by crooks promising a valuable gift. Seriously, people, are we still falling for this?

The victim, a resident of sector 6, Panvel, received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number claiming she'd won a prize. Hooked, she was then told to pay "customs" and "taxes" to release the so-called gift. Over several days, she transferred huge chunks of money to various accounts provided by the scammers. 

Police Inspector Nitin Patil from Panvel Police Station confirmed the case is now registered under relevant sections of the IT Act. The investigation is ongoing, but let's be real, the money is probably gone. Consider this an expensive reminder: if it sounds too good to be true (like a random stranger gifting you expensive things), it absolutely is. Report Cyber crime at 1930.
