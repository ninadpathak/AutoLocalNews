> **TLDR**: Some loser made a fake Instagram account and posted obscene garbage of a teenager. The cyber police finally caught the idiot.

A Taloja resident is cooling his heels after allegedly creating a fake Instagram account to post vile content featuring a local teen. The Navi Mumbai cyber police arrested the 23-year-old this week, proving that sometimes, justice actually works.

According to the cops, the accused, identified as [REDACTED because you can't name suspects], lifted photos of the victim and created a bogus profile. Then, he allegedly started posting seriously nasty stuff. The victim's family raised hell, and rightly so.

The case was registered under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act (basically, the 'being a digital dirtbag' clause) and various sections of the IPC. He's currently enjoying the hospitality of the Taloja jail. Maybe he can reflect on his life choices there.
