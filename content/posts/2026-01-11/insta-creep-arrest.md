> **TLDR**: Nerul teen harassed with fake Instagram profile. Cyber cops nabbed the culprit; turns out, it's an uncle from Sector 21. 

If you thought Instagram was just for brunch pics and influencer scams, think again. A 19-year-old from Nerul found out the hard way when some loser created a fake account in her name and started posting obscene garbage. Think morphed photos and creepy DMs sent to her contacts. Nightmare fuel.

The Cyber Crime unit at Belapur sprang into action faster than you can say "catfish." They traced the digital footprints back to a 34-year-old named… well, let’s just call him "Uncle Creepy" from Sector 21. Turns out, he knew the victim. Shocker.

Uncle Creepy is now enjoying an extended stay courtesy of the Indian Penal Code and the IT Act. His devices are confiscated. The charges are serious. Meanwhile, the teen is dealing with the fallout of having her digital identity hijacked by some random dude with too much time on his hands.

Moral of the story? Lock down your profile, people. And if some creep starts messing with your online vibe, report their accounts. And maybe move to Panvel. Just kidding. (Mostly.)
