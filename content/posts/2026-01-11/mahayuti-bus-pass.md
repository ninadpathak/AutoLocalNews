> **TLDR**: Mahayuti's manifesto for Mumbai's civic polls includes a 50% bus fare cut for women. Think of all the extra vada pav one could buy with that. 

The Mahayuti alliance (BJP, Shiv Sena, NCP) just dropped their manifesto for the upcoming Mumbai civic elections. The big promise? Women get half-price bus tickets. 

Imagine ₹10 trips from Panvel to Belapur costing just ₹5. According to the manifesto, this aims to ease travel for women and potentially free up household budgets. It will probably also be a nightmare for bus conductors.

The manifesto also outlined plans for new healthcare initiatives and infrastructure upgrades. Specifics on funding and timelines? Still hazy. But hey, cheap bus rides are something concrete.

Will this sway voters? Maybe. Will it make the BEST buses even more crowded? Almost definitely. One thing’s for sure: expect heated debates at bus stops across Navi Mumbai.
