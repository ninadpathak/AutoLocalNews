> **TLDR**: Fed up with disappearing mangroves, Navi Mumbai residents launched a new environmental initiative. Finally, someone is doing something about CIDCO's relentless 'development'.

Anger is brewing in Navi Mumbai. Residents, tired of watching wetlands vanish under concrete, have launched a citizens' movement. Their goal? To protect the city's remaining mangroves, lakes, and vital ecosystems.

The "Save Navi Mumbai's Wetlands" initiative kicked off last week with a series of awareness campaigns across nodes like Nerul, Seawoods, and CBD Belapur. Volunteers are documenting illegal dumping, encroachments, and unreported construction near sensitive areas.

The Free Press Journal highlighted the group's immediate focus: pressuring the NMMC and CIDCO to enforce existing environmental regulations. They're also demanding greater transparency in environmental impact assessments for new projects. One activist, speaking from Sector 21 in Nerul, stated: "We're not against development, but it can't come at the cost of our natural heritage."

Local ornithologists have noted a sharp decline in migratory bird populations visiting the DPS Lake in Nerul and the Talave wetlands near Panvel, directly correlating with increased construction activity. Is anyone surprised? The group plans to escalate its campaign with public demonstrations and legal challenges if necessary. It's about time somebody fought back.
