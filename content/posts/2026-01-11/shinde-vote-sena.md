> **TLDR**: Eknath Shinde wants you to vote Shiv Sena in the upcoming NMMC elections. Because apparently, only *they* can build things. 

Chief Minister Eknath Shinde is on the campaign trail, telling Navi Mumbaikars that a vote for Shiv Sena is a vote for "development." Because the current roads write themselves, right?

Speaking at a rally in, unsurprisingly, Thane, Shinde urged residents to back the party in the upcoming Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) polls. The promise? Continued progress, prosperity, and all that jazz.

He conveniently forgot to mention the last time the Sena held power in the NMMC. Maybe because remembering is hard. Or maybe because the potholes remember for us.

Shinde laid claim to various infrastructure projects. These include the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link (MTHL) and the Navi Mumbai International Airport. He didn't actually *build* them, mind you, but hey, details.

The CM also touted the state government's commitment to improving infrastructure in Navi Mumbai. He mentioned ongoing projects aimed at easing traffic congestion and enhancing connectivity. Translation: more diversions coming to a road near you.

So, there you have it. Vote Shiv Sena, and maybe, just maybe, that pothole outside your building will finally get filled. Or, you know, they will build another giant statue.
