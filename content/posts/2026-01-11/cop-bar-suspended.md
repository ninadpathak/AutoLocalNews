> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai cop is suspended after a video surfaced of him showering cash on bar dancers. We're not sure what's worse: the cop's actions or the terrible music in the background.

The khaki uniform doesn't exactly scream "responsible financial decisions," but a Navi Mumbai police officer apparently missed that memo. A video went viral this week showing him tossing rupee notes at dancers in a bar. Now, he's suspended.

The video, allegedly filmed at a bar in the Sector 17 area of Vashi, shows the officer, identified as a constable from the local traffic division, gleefully making it rain. The suspension order came down directly from the office of the Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner.

Internal affairs is "delving" into the matter (just kidding, they're *looking* into it). The big question: where did that cash come from? Was it from his own salary, or worse?

Reactions online range from outrage to (frankly, disturbing) amusement. One user commented, "He's just stimulating the local economy!" Others are less forgiving, demanding a full investigation. For now, the cop is off duty and probably regretting that last tequila shot. Maybe he should try investing in mutual funds instead.
