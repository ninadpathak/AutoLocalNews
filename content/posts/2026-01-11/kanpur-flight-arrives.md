> **TLDR**: IndiGo launches direct Kanpur-Navi Mumbai flights by January end. Finally, a reason to look forward to January.

Forget that brutal drive to Mumbai for your connecting flight. IndiGo is launching a direct flight from Kanpur to Navi Mumbai's airport by the end of January. Finally, less travel time and more time arguing with your relatives.

The Times of India reports the new route will offer daily service. Exact timings and fares are still under wraps, but expect the usual scramble for those initial cheap seats.

Think of it: You could be eating *thagguladoo* in Kanpur in the morning and battling the Vashi bridge traffic by evening. Peak efficiency.

This is a big win for the Navi Mumbai airport, which desperately needs more routes. Hopefully, this is just the beginning. Maybe they'll even fix the potholes on the way to the terminal… one day.
