A Nerul student lost ₹2 lakh, including scholarship funds, to a sophisticated cyber fraud this week. The incident underscores the rising threat of online scams targeting Navi Mumbai residents.

The victim, a student residing in Sector 21, received a fraudulent link disguised as a scholarship disbursement notification. Upon clicking, the link redirected to a fake banking interface that mimicked the IDBI bank's portal. The student entered their credentials, unknowingly compromising their account.

Within minutes, ₹2 lakh was siphoned off. The Nerul police station has registered a case. Authorities urge residents to verify the authenticity of online communications before sharing personal information. This incident is a stark reminder: digital literacy is now a first line of defense.
