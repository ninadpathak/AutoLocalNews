> **TLDR**: WPL 2026 opening ceremony was a Bollywood bonanza. Expect traffic around the DY Patil Stadium; blame Honey Singh.

Jacqueline Fernandez's dance moves and Yo Yo Honey Singh's, well, *everything*, kicked off the Women's Premier League 2026 in spectacular (and loud) fashion. Forget cricket for a minute; Sector 12, Nerul, became a concert venue last night. The noise levels probably registered on the Richter scale.

Fernandez's performance included what eyewitnesses are calling a “dazzling” medley of hits. Honey Singh followed, unleashing his signature brand of earworms (prepare for inescapable remixes at every auto stand from Belapur to Panvel). The crowd went wild. Our eardrums? Less so.

If you were anywhere near the DY Patil Stadium, you likely experienced sound bleed rivaling a monsoon downpour. Expect lingering traffic snarls around the stadium area today as attendees recover and displaced rickshaws navigate the chaos. Blame the bass drops, not us. 

The NMMC better have earplugs ready for the rest of the tournament. And maybe a traffic plan that extends beyond Sector 12. Because Honey Singh isn't going anywhere. Neither is the WPL, apparently.
