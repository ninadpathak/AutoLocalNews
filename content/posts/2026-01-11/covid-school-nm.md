> **TLDR**: 18 students at a Navi Mumbai school tested positive for COVID. Remember when we *didn't* have to worry about this? Good times.

The COVID era isn't quite done with us yet. 18 students at a school in Sector 29, Vashi, tested positive for COVID-19 this week, sending a ripple of anxiety through parents.

The NMMC health department confirmed the cluster on Wednesday. Contact tracing is underway, and the school has been temporarily shut down for sanitization. Let's hope the BMC doesn't mess this one up.

Rumors are flying on Dad's WhatsApp about the new variant. An NMMC spokesperson urged calm and promised regular updates. Remember the days of banging *thalis* and pretending it would help? Yeah, us neither.

The affected students are reportedly exhibiting mild symptoms. Parents are being advised to monitor their children for fever, cough, and loss of taste. Anyone else getting a weird sense of deja vu?

For now, it's masks on again, folks. And maybe lay off the *pani puri* for a while. Just in case.
