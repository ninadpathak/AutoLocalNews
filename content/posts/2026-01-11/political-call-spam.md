> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbaikars are getting spammed by political calls. Where did they get your number? Probably everywhere.

Are you getting daily calls from politicians you've never heard of? Welcome to the club. Residents across Navi Mumbai are reporting a sudden surge in campaign calls and SMS blasts, leaving many wondering how their contact information ended up on some party's database.

The answer? Data brokers, leaky databases, and the fine print nobody reads. Your number could be scraped from online directories, bought from third-party app developers, or even lifted from a local shop's loyalty program. Remember that form you filled out at D-Mart in Seawoods? That's a bingo.

Politicians aren't hacking into your phone (probably). They're just buying access to the mountain of data we all casually generate. Think voter lists combined with marketing databases. It's legal-ish, and it's definitely annoying.

So, what can you do? Register for DND, block numbers aggressively, and embrace the silent phone. Or, you know, answer the call and mess with them. Sector 17, Vashi, wants to know if anyone has tried that. We think it's a public service.
