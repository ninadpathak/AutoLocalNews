> **TLDR**: High Court says BJP candidate's rejection was bogus. Ward 64 election is back on track, get ready to vote.

The legal drama in Ward 64 took another turn. The Bombay High Court just overturned the Election Commission's decision to reject the BJP candidate's nomination. Translation? The election that was put on hold is now back in business.

Remember how the whole thing got delayed? Some argued the BJP candidate's paperwork wasn't up to snuff. The court didn't buy it. They basically said, "Hold up, that rejection wasn't legit."

So, what's next? The election in Ward 64 is a go. Expect the political mudslinging to intensify faster than the humidity in Nerul during monsoon. No one needs this kind of heat.

This could be a major shake-up for the local political landscape. Will the BJP capitalize on this second chance? Or will another party swoop in and steal the show? Only time (and the voters of Ward 64) will tell.
