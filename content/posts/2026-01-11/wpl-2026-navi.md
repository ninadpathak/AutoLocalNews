> **TLDR**: The Women's Premier League 2026 is coming, with games in Navi Mumbai. Get ready for some sixes (and maybe some traffic). 

Navi Mumbai is gearing up for more cricket action. The WPL 2026 schedule dropped, and DY Patil Stadium is hosting a chunk of the matches. Forget the IPL; this is where the real drama happens (probably).

All five teams are back, with a few captain changes. Word on the street (aka, WION) is that the squads are locked and loaded. Expect fireworks when Mumbai Indians and UP Warriorz clash. The first ball will be bowled soon.

Want to know who's playing when? Check the full schedule online. Get ready to brave the crowds. And maybe learn some cricket terms so you don't sound like a total noob. Enjoy the games!
