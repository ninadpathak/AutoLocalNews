> **TLDR**: NMMC is shutting off the water to Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri on Sunday. Stock up on H2O now, or prepare for a very dry day, you parched landlubbers.

Yep, you read that right. No water. The NMMC water supply will be disrupted this Sunday, thanks to "urgent repairs" at the Hetawane Dam. Residents of Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri are going to be real thirsty. Brace yourselves, folks.

The shutdown starts at 10:00 AM and is *scheduled* to end at 6:00 PM. But, come on, are we really betting on that? Better plan for a full day without the sweet, sweet hydration. So, that's Sector 1 to Sector 46 in Kharghar, all of Ulwe, and the entirety of Dronagiri node facing a waterless Sunday. 

NMMC says they're fixing a major leak. But realistically, this means strategically hoarding water like you're prepping for the apocalypse. Fill those buckets, people! May the odds be ever in your favor (of finding a full tanker).
