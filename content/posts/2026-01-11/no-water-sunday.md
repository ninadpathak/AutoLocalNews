> **TLDR**: Dry taps hit Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri this Sunday. CIDCO's fixing something, so fill those buckets and prepare for a classic Navi Mumbai water crisis.

Heads up, folks in Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri: Sunday's looking parched. CIDCO announced a water supply disruption for “urgent repairs.” Translation: something broke. The official line is that supply will be off from 10 AM to 6 PM. Unofficially? Pack extra patience. 

The disruption impacts all of Kharghar, Ulwe, and Dronagiri. So, whether you're in Sector 12, plotting a Dronagiri escape to Panvel, or chilling in Ulwe, get ready to conserve. CIDCO assures us tankers will be deployed. We suggest staking out your spot early. This isn't their first rodeo.

While CIDCO hasn't specified the exact nature of the repairs, the timing conveniently avoids blaming it on summer. Expect social media to light up with complaints by lunchtime. Remember those old water conservation posters from your school days? Dust them off. You’ll need them.
