> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai's shiny new airport has one major flaw: zero phone signal. Good luck getting a cab after you land; you'll need it.

So, you've touched down at the spanking new Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA). Congratulations! Now try getting a cab. Passengers are discovering a rather large problem: zero, zilch, *nada* network connectivity.

Think post-landing bliss turning into a frantic scramble for a signal outside the terminal. Imagine dozens of people wandering around like lost tourists, desperately searching for that one bar of network to hail a ride.

The absence of mobile network inside the arrival area is turning what should be a seamless process into a frustrating ordeal. Forget about booking a ride via Ola or Uber the moment you deplane.

One passenger we spoke to described the scene as "utter chaos." He mentioned having to walk nearly a kilometer to get a signal strong enough to book a cab. Apparently, the issue has been raised with the airport authorities, but so far, no fix. Until then, prepare for a digital detox upon arrival... whether you like it or not. Maybe pack a carrier pigeon just in case.
