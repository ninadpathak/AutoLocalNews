> **TLDR**: Metro Line 1 oscillation trials are donezo. Get ready for slightly less chaotic commutes, maybe.

Line 1 of the Navi Mumbai Metro just cleared a hurdle. Oscillation trials – basically, testing how the train bounces around – wrapped up successfully this week.

CRISIL (that's the Railway's safety watchdog) signed off on the reports. This means Line 1 is closer than ever to actually carrying people.

But don't hold your breath just yet. There's still the small matter of CMRS (Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety) inspection and final approval. Remember that skywalk near the station that was "almost ready" for, like, a decade?

The 11.1 km line connects Belapur to Pendhar, snaking through 11 stations. Expect slightly less insane traffic on the Sion-Panvel highway *eventually.*

The question remains: when will we *actually* be able to ditch the overcrowded buses and rickshaws? Place your bets now.
