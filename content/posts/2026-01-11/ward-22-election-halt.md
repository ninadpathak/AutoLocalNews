> **TLDR**: Ward 22 will not vote on January 15th. A BJP candidate got a court to put the election on pause; expect a legal battle.

The Navi Mumbai election cycle took another wild turn. The Bombay High Court just granted an interim stay, halting the Ward 22 election. This follows a petition filed by a BJP candidate, throwing a wrench into the NMMC's plans.

Details are still emerging, but the core issue revolves around alleged irregularities in the nomination process. The BJP candidate claims their nomination was wrongly rejected. Now, a judge agrees, at least for now.

What does this mean for Ward 22 voters? For now, they are in limbo. The other candidates are left hanging. The SEC will need to figure out its next move.

Expect a flurry of legal filings. This could delay the overall election results for weeks. The political drama continues, folks.
