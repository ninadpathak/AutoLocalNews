> **TLDR**: Politicians are blasting music and setting off firecrackers during the election, despite terrible air quality. Apparently, common sense isn't a prerequisite for running for office in this town.

Navi Mumbai residents are losing their minds over non-stop election noise. According to one fed-up resident in Kharghar Sector 35, the non-stop music is bad enough, but the firecrackers are next-level dumb.

"Do they not realize how bad the AQI already is?" asked /u/Sl3nderMusic on Reddit. We're guessing the answer is a hard no.

Between the honking convoys clogging roads from Belapur to Nerul and now this? It's like these guys are actively trying to lose votes. Maybe someone should send them a memo about the AQI levels in Turbhe MIDC. 

Forget promises of development. How about a little peace and quiet? Maybe a pledge to not actively poison the air we breathe? Just a thought.
