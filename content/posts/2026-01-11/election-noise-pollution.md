> **TLDR**: Relentless election promotions are blasting Navi Mumbai with noise pollution. Candidates preaching "citizen welfare" are deafening the city into submission.

Is anyone else ready to throw a brick at the next political van that rolls through their sector? Navi Mumbai's municipal elections have unleashed a tsunami of noise pollution. It's a non-stop assault of loudspeakers, distorted microphones, and slogans cranked to eleven.

From Nerul to Kharghar, the story is the same. Early morning to late night, eardrums are being violated. Forget working from home or catching some sleep. Political parties are mainlining propaganda into our lives, whether we like it or not.

And the hypocrisy is truly something. Every candidate drones on about "development" and "quality of life". Yet, not a single one seems to give a damn about basic noise control. If this is how they treat us *before* getting elected, what fresh hell awaits us afterward?

So, here's a question for the candidates: Are you trying to win votes, or drive us all insane? Because right now, it feels like you're succeeding at the latter.
