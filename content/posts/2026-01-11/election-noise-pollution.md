> **TLDR**: Politicians are blasting music and setting off firecrackers during the election, making the already bad air quality even worse. Honestly, do they even live here?

The election season has brought the usual cacophony, but this year, residents are breathing more than just political promises. Loud music and firecrackers have become the soundtrack to campaigning, much to the dismay of anyone trying to, you know, breathe.

One resident vented on Reddit about the constant noise and, more importantly, the blatant disregard for the city's already struggling air quality. "They've been blasting music since the past week...but they’ve been bursting fire crackers???" They added, questioning the politicians' awareness (or care) for the AQI. 

It’s hard to miss the irony. Politicians promise a better future while simultaneously polluting the air we breathe today. Sector 17 residents, in particular, have reported late-night firework displays. Meanwhile, the AQI hovers around "unhealthy" levels, according to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.

Is this really the best way to win votes? Maybe some quiet reflection on policy—instead of deafening explosions—would be a breath of fresh air.
