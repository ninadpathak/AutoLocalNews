> **TLDR**: Over a thousand students linked up to promote voting in the 2026 NMMC elections. Is a human chain enough to break through the apathy? 

Forget the usual rallies. This time, 1100 students from various Navi Mumbai schools and colleges formed a human chain yesterday morning. The goal? To raise awareness about the upcoming Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) elections in 2026. 

The chain snaked through Sector 15 in Vashi, near the APMC market. Organizers from the NMMC's election commission handed out pamphlets. They also shouted slogans about the importance of every vote. A valiant effort, for sure.

But does this actually work? Will a human chain in Vashi convince someone in Kharghar to ditch their Netflix binge and head to the polls? Unclear. Voter apathy in Navi Mumbai is legendary. Remember the measly turnout in the 2021 elections?

The NMMC needs more than publicity stunts. They need to address the issues that make people shrug: infrastructure woes, water shortages, and the endless construction. Until then, these chains are just photo ops. Nice try, though.
