> **TLDR**: Four Nerul landlords got booked for illegally renting to eight Nigerians. Expect fines, maybe jail time, and definitely awkward society meetings.

Nerul's getting spicy. Four landlords in Sector 21 are in deep trouble. They're accused of renting their flats to eight Nigerian nationals… without doing the paperwork. 

The cops filed the FIR after a raid last week. Turns out, these landlords skipped the mandatory police verification. That's a big no-no.

Think this is just a slap on the wrist? Think again. We're talking potential fines, even jail time under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. Plus, imagine the gossip at the next society meeting! The NRI complex residents are gonna *love* this. 

One thing's for sure, these landlords are learning a very expensive lesson: when you rent, do it right. Or get ready for a knock on the door from the Khargar police.
