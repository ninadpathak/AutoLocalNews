> **TLDR**: The WPL 2026 opening ceremony is gonna be lit. Honey Singh, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Harnaaz Sandhu will be there, so get ready to groove, even if you don't understand cricket.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is pulling out all the stops for the Women's Premier League (WPL) 2026 opening ceremony. The event, scheduled for March 5th at the DY Patil Stadium in Nerul, promises Bollywood glitz alongside cricket action.

Honey Singh is headlining. Jacqueline Fernandez will be there too. And Harnaaz Sandhu will be there, bringing some serious beauty-queen vibes to Navi Mumbai.

Will the performances be good? Who cares! It's a chance to see some celebrities and pretend you understand the rules of cricket. Gates open at 5:30 PM; the first match starts at 7:30 PM. Get ready for some noise.

Tickets are available online, starting at ₹499. That's about the same price as two butter chickens. Choose wisely.
