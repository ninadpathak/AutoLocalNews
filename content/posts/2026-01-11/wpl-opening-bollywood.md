> **TLDR**: The WPL 2026 opening ceremony at DY Patil was a Bollywood extravaganza. Harnaaz Sandhu, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Honey Singh all performed, because of course they did.

The DY Patil Stadium got a Bollywood-sized shot of adrenaline last night, kicking off the 2026 Women's Premier League. Harnaaz Sandhu graced the stage, because apparently being Miss Universe wasn't enough excitement for one lifetime. Jacqueline Fernandez brought the dance moves (and probably a few headlines), and Honey Singh… well, he brought Honey Singh.

Reportedly, ₹5 Crore was spent on pyrotechnics alone. That's right, 5 Crore. Because nothing says "women's cricket" like blowing up a small fortune in Sector 7.

The crowd went wild, the players looked vaguely embarrassed, and the BCCI executives probably popped champagne corks in their VIP boxes. The WPL is officially here, folks. May the best team win (and may the eardrums of Sector 12 residents recover swiftly).
