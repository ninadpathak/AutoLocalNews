> **TLDR**: A Panvel woman lost ₹45.91 lakh in a "gift" cyber scam. Seriously, folks, if someone offers you free money online, run the other way. 

The oldest trick in the book just got a high-tech makeover. A 58-year-old woman from Panvel's Khanda Colony got rinsed for a staggering ₹45.91 lakh by online scammers promising a gift. It started with a friendly message and ended with an empty bank account. 

The fraudsters, posing as generous gift-givers, lured her into a web of fake customs duties and processing fees. Every payment she made only dug her deeper. ₹46 Lakh vanished. 

The Panvel police station has registered a case under relevant sections of the IT Act. But let’s be real, the chances of recovering the money are slim. Consider this a very expensive lesson: Block, delete, and NEVER pay to receive a “free” gift. Seriously, that Playstation 5 isn't worth it.
