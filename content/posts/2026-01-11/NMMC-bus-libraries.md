Commuters awaiting buses in Navi Mumbai can now indulge in a spot of reading, courtesy of a novel initiative by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC). Select bus shelters across the city have been transformed into miniature libraries, stocked with a diverse collection of books ranging from fiction to non-fiction. 

The initiative, spearheaded by the NMMC's library department, aims to promote reading habits among citizens and make waiting time more productive. The first such 'bus shelter library' was inaugurated near the APMC market in Vashi, Sector 19, with plans to extend the concept to other key locations, including Nerul and CBD Belapur. Initial reports indicate a high rate of engagement, with commuters borrowing books using the provided check-out system.

While the scheme’s initial outlay remains undisclosed, sources within the NMMC suggest a reliance on book donations from residents and local organizations, minimizing the financial burden on the corporation. This initiative underscores the NMMC's broader strategy of leveraging public spaces to enhance civic engagement and promote intellectual enrichment. Whether this pilot program will extend to all 1397 bus stops in the city remains to be seen, but early returns are promising.
