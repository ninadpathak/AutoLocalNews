> **TLDR**: Eknath Shinde rallied support for Shiv Sena in the upcoming NMMC elections, promising development. Are we buying what he's selling?

Chief Minister Eknath Shinde wants your vote. He's pitching Shiv Sena as the key to Navi Mumbai's continued glow-up ahead of the NMMC elections.

Shinde, speaking to residents, highlighted the Sena's commitment to development. No specifics were given, but the implication was clear: keep the Sena in power, keep the progress rolling.

"Vote for Shiv Sena for development," Shinde urged. Considering the current state of potholes in Sector 17, some residents might need more convincing. Others likely remain loyal to the Thackerays.

The election season is heating up, and every party is dialing up the rhetoric. Whether Shinde's promises translate into votes remains to be seen. Is this a bold vision, or just another election promise that vanishes faster than the monsoon's end?
