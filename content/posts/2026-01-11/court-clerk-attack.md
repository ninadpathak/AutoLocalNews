> **TLDR**: A High Court clerk was assaulted and threatened in Navi Mumbai during a land possession. Sounds like someone didn't want to give up their plot of land.

Trouble flared during a land possession process in Navi Mumbai. A High Court clerk was allegedly assaulted and threatened by a father-son duo. This happened while the clerk was carrying out their official duties.

The incident occurred in connection with a land dispute case. Reportedly, the father and son obstructed the clerk from taking possession of the land. Things escalated quickly.

The accused allegedly manhandled the clerk and issued threats. A case has been registered against the duo at the local police station. No word yet on the charges, but obstructing a court order (and assault) probably isn't going to help their case. The NMMC better have some strong chai ready for the clerk.
