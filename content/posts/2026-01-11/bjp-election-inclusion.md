> **TLDR**: The High Court told the election commission to add the BJP candidate to the Navi Mumbai ward candidate list. Bureaucracy: 1, Democracy: 0.

Looks like someone in the election office forgot to do their homework. The Bombay High Court just ordered the State Election Commission (SEC) to include a BJP candidate on the ballot for the upcoming NMMC elections. Seriously, *again*?

The court’s order came after the BJP nominee filed a petition contesting the SEC's initial omission. Details are still trickling in, but early reports suggest a clerical error involving submitted paperwork for Ward 63 in Sector 14, Vashi.

How does a political party *get left off* a ballot? This isn't a typo; it's an administrative screw-up of epic proportions. One has to wonder if this incompetence, or something else entirely? Either way, get ready for more posters and political shouting matches near the station.
