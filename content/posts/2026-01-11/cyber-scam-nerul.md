> **TLDR**: A Nerul student got fleeced for ₹2 lakhs in scholarship money. Cyber crooks are getting bolder, and Navi Mumbai is the new hunting ground.

Another day, another cyber scam. This time, a student from Nerul's Sector 21 lost ₹2 lakhs—including hard-earned scholarship funds—to online fraudsters. The con artists, posing as bank officials, sweet-talked the student into handing over sensitive account details under the guise of a 'verification process'. Classic. 

The victim, whose name is being withheld, reported the incident to the Cyber Crime Cell. Initial investigations suggest a phishing scam originating from outside Maharashtra. No surprises there. While the police are 'investigating', that ₹2 lakh is probably sipping margaritas on a beach in Goa by now.

CIDCO needs to launch a serious awareness campaign. These scams are getting way too common, and students shouldn't have to navigate phishing attempts while juggling exams. Maybe a mandatory cyber-safety class is in order, because right now, Sector 21 is feeling less like a learning hub and more like a target. The takeaway? Don't trust anyone online, especially if they claim to be from your bank. Your scholarship depends on it.
