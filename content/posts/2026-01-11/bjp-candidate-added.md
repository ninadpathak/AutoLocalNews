> **TLDR**: The High Court ordered the NMMC to include a BJP candidate in the upcoming civic elections. Finally, something remotely interesting in Sector 17.

Looks like the BJP’s getting a last-minute boost in the NMMC election showdown. The Bombay High Court just told the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) to stick a BJP candidate’s name back on the ballot. Someone, somewhere, is scrambling.

The legal dust-up revolved around a rejected nomination (Ward number unconfirmed at time of print). The BJP cried foul, and the HC seems to have agreed. The NMMC, known for its glacial pace on everything from pothole repair to hawker relocation, now has to move fast to update the candidate list. Wonder how *that's* going.

What does this mean for the actual election? Hard to say. But expect some serious campaigning in the affected ward as the BJP tries to capitalize on this win. And maybe, just maybe, this will inject a bit of actual competition into what’s been a pretty predictable race so far. Frankly, we are ready for something to watch other than the Seawoods flamingo migration.
