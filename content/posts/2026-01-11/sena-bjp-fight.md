> **TLDR**: Shiv Sena accuses a BJP leader of corruption in Navi Mumbai development projects. It's just politicians fighting, business as usual.

The gloves are off. The Shiv Sena (UBT) is going after a prominent Navi Mumbai BJP leader, accusing him of shady dealings in ongoing NMMC projects. Apparently, someone's been skimming from the top.

The Sena's local bigwigs held a press conference yesterday, alleging the BJP leader (who shall remain nameless for now) has been using his influence to line his pockets. They pointed fingers at irregularities in the Sector 14 flyover construction, claiming inflated costs and substandard materials. ₹50 crore gone poof? Maybe more.

"He's turning Navi Mumbai into his personal ATM," roared one Sena spokesperson, conveniently forgetting their own party's track record. Expect the BJP to fire back soon. This could get ugly, and entertaining. More drama than a Balaji Telefilms marathon.

Meanwhile, the NMMC remains silent. Surprise. Commuters stuck in jams near the flyover construction site have their own opinions, none of them printable.
