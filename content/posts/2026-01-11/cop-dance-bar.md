> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai constable got suspended for some off-duty entertainment at a ladies' dance bar. Honestly, who hasn't wanted to blow off steam after a long shift?

Another day, another scandal in the NMMC. This time, it involves one of our finest enjoying some *questionable* R&R. 

The constable, attached to the Vashi police station (name withheld, because come on), was caught on camera at a dance bar in, get this, Thane. Apparently, Sector 17 isn't the only place to unwind after a hard day of fining auto-rickshaws.

The video went viral faster than you can say "suspension order." The top brass at Police HQ saw it, and the inevitable happened: the constable is now cooling his heels, pending an inquiry. An internal investigation is underway.

So, what's the lesson here? Maybe stick to chai at the tapri next time. Or, you know, uphold the law you swore to protect? Either way, the NMMC just got a little less interesting, and a lot more awkward.
