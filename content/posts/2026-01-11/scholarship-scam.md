> **TLDR**: A student lost ₹2 lakh, including scholarship money, to cyber fraud. Seriously, people, stop clicking random links! 

Imagine your scholarship money vanishing into thin air. That's exactly what happened to one unlucky student in Kharghar last week. They got scammed out of ₹2 lakh.

The student, whose name is being withheld because, you know, victim-blaming is a thing, clicked on a link promising some kind of scholarship update. Instead, the link stole their banking details. ₹2 Lakh. Gone.

Navi Mumbai Police's cybercrime unit is "investigating" (read: filling out paperwork). Meanwhile, the student is probably eating Maggi for the next six months. The cops are urging everyone to not click on suspicious links. 

Pro-tip: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Also, maybe forward those dodgy links to that annoying uncle who shares conspiracy theories. Just kidding (mostly).
