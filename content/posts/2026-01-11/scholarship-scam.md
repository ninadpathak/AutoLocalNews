> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai student lost ₹2 lakh to cyber fraud, including scholarship funds. Seriously, people, the internet is still trying to steal your money. 

A Panvel student's bank account just got lighter by ₹2 lakh, thanks to some smooth-talking cyber crooks. The victim, a bright spark trying to make ends meet, saw a chunk of their scholarship money vanish into thin air. That's right, they targeted a student's scholarship. Scum.

The scam went down when the student clicked a link – we all know you shouldn't do that, right? – promising some kind of scholarship update. Instead, it sucked them into a phishing vortex, draining their account faster than you can say "cybercrime."

The Panvel Taluka police station is "investigating," which probably means they're filing paperwork. In the meantime, consider this your daily reminder: treat every link like it's trying to steal your kidneys. Especially if it promises free money.

This isn't the first time Navi Mumbai's seen digital skulduggery. From fake lotteries to bogus investment schemes, the cyber thugs are working overtime. Maybe it's time for a city-wide "don't be an idiot online" campaign. Just a thought.
