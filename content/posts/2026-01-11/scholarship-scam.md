> **TLDR**: A student lost ₹2 lakh, including scholarship money, to cyber fraud. Seriously, can't anyone keep our money safe?

The dream of higher education just got a lot more expensive for one Nerul student. A cyber fraud wiped out ₹2 lakh from their account, including a hefty chunk of scholarship funds earmarked for tuition at SIES College.

The scam played out with classic simplicity. Posing as a bank representative, the fraudster called the student and sweet-talked them into sharing sensitive banking details. The entire sum vanished within minutes. Nerul police station has registered a case, but recovering digital ghosts is always a long shot.

This isn't just about the money. It's about the system failing students who are trying to build a future. The real question: Who's holding banks accountable for letting this happen again and again?
