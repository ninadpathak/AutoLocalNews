> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 passes oscillation trials. Get ready to ditch the auto rickshaw; trains are coming soon. 

Sector 1’s elevated steel is about to get a whole lot busier. The Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1, linking Belapur to Pendhar, just wrapped up its oscillation trials. This means the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) is about to give the green light. No more sweating it out on the Thane-Belapur road. 

CIDCO is saying operations will commence shortly. The line covers 11 stations and slices through the heart of the city. Think direct access to the APMC market, the Central Park vibe, and all those Cyber City jobs. The project saw a few delays, but the double-engine sarkar seems to have gotten things moving again. Expect some grandstanding from local politicians looking for photo ops when the first train rolls in, but don't hold your breath. 

The only question now: can they stick to the schedule and avoid more Kharghar-style gridlock? Place your bets. The NMMC better get those feeder buses sorted; otherwise, it's going to be chaos at the stations.
