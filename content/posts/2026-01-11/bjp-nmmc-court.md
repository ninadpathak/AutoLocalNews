> **TLDR**: Bombay High Court says NMMC must include BJP candidate in the upcoming civic polls. So much for streamlining the ballot, eh?

Looks like someone's name got lost in the NMMC shuffle. The Bombay High Court just ordered the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation to include a BJP candidate on the ballot for the upcoming civic elections.

Apparently, there was some kind of omission in Ward Number 114 (Sector 14, Vashi). The BJP nominee's paperwork was initially rejected, leading to the court intervention. Now, the NMMC has to reprint the whole candidate list. Wonder who's footing that bill?

The HC bench, after reviewing the presented documents, found no valid reason for the initial rejection. The NMMC better have a good explanation. The court's directive ensures that voters in Sector 14 get a full slate of options, even if it means a little extra paperwork for the election officials. This also gives said BJP nominee another shot at the race.

This is hardly the first time the NMMC's election processes have raised eyebrows. You'd think they'd have figured it out by now.
