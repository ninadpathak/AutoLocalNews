> **TLDR**: Bombay High Court revived a BJP candidate's NMMC nomination. Bureaucratic bungling almost sidelined a key player, but the courts said "nah."

The BJP's Sandeep Thakur is back in the NMMC election ring after the Bombay High Court intervened. Some paperwork snafu threatened to sideline him, but justice (allegedly) prevailed.

Thakur's nomination for Ward 114 (Turbhe) was initially tossed out by the NMMC election officer. Reason? A missing Form B – basically, the BJP's official stamp of approval. Thakur cried foul, arguing he'd submitted everything correctly. The Court agreed, pointing fingers at the NMMC for the mix-up.

So, what's the fallout? Thakur's back on the ballot, obviously. More broadly, it's another black eye for NMMC's election machinery, which apparently can't handle basic paperwork without a High Court intervention. The actual election just became a lot more interesting…and litigious.
