> **TLDR**: Mahayuti's BMC manifesto is here, promising everything from Marathi housing to global city status. Are we holding our breath? Not really.

The Mahayuti alliance is at it again, dangling shiny promises before the upcoming BMC elections. This time, they're waving the flag of "Marathi pride" while promising a Mumbai transformed by 2030. Did anyone ask for another transformation?

The manifesto, unveiled earlier today, pledges housing for the Marathi "manus" (because apparently, everyone else can live under a bridge), infrastructure upgrades (probably more skywalks nobody uses), and benefits targeted specifically at women. Because nothing says equality like targeted benefits, right?

Their grand vision? Turning Mumbai into a "global city." Because apparently, traffic jams, overflowing garbage bins, and crumbling infrastructure scream "global." They’re aiming for world-class status. We'll see.

Maybe this time, they'll deliver. Or maybe we'll just get more political theatre. Place your bets, folks.
