> **TLDR**: Nandani Sharma and Triveni Vasistha get their first taste of the big leagues as Delhi Capitals bowl against Mumbai Indians. About time some fresh blood got a shot; maybe they'll bring the heat! 

The Delhi Capitals won the toss and elected to bowl against the Mumbai Indians, but the real story is the debutantes. Nandani Sharma and Triveni Vasistha are finally getting their chance to shine. Can they handle the pressure cooker of a MI batting lineup?

Sharma, a right-arm medium pacer, has been tearing it up in domestic cricket. Vasistha, an off-spinner, brings much-needed variety to the DC attack. Word is Vasistha’s googly is a thing of beauty; let's see if MI batters agree.

The Capitals are desperate for a win after a shaky start to the season. Maybe these fresh faces are exactly what they need to shake things up. Or maybe they'll get eaten alive. Either way, it's going to be a wild ride.

The match is underway at the Y Patil Sports Academy. The stands are packed, the sun is blazing, and the stakes are high. Time to see if these rookies can become Record breakers.
