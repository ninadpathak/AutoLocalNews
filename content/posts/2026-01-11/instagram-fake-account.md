A 23-year-old Kharghar resident was apprehended this week for creating a fake Instagram account impersonating a local teenager and posting obscene content. The cybercrime unit of the Navi Mumbai police, acting on a complaint filed by the victim's family from Sector 12, traced the IP address to a residence near Little World Mall. 

The accused, identified as Rohan Sharma, allegedly created the profile using a stolen photograph and proceeded to upload sexually suggestive material, causing significant distress to the victim and her family. The investigation revealed Sharma was a distant acquaintance of the teen. The charges include identity theft and violation of India's IT Act.

This incident underscores the increasing vulnerability of young Navi Mumbai residents to cybercrime. While the police's swift action is commendable, questions remain about the efficacy of parental controls and digital literacy programs in schools across Panvel taluka. The case will be heard at the Belapur court, where the prosecution intends to present digital forensics evidence to secure a conviction. For Sector 12 residents, this serves as a stark reminder of the dark side of social media and the need for heightened vigilance.
