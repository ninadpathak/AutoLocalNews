> **TLDR**: Ditch doomscrolling; grab a book on your commute. NMMC turns NMMT buses into rolling libraries, offering Sector 17 aunties and Cyber City execs some literary respite. 

Forget fighting for a seat; now you can battle for the last copy of Chetan Bhagat on the 520 route. The NMMC, in a move that's either genius or a logistical nightmare, has kitted out select NMMT buses with mini-libraries. Passengers can now borrow books for free while navigating the Vashi bridge gridlock or crawling through Nerul. 

The initiative aims to promote reading habits among Navi Mumbai's perpetually-commuting population. Initial reports suggest a high demand for self-help books and Sidney Sheldon novels (classic!). The bus conductors are now moonlighting as librarians, armed with overdue notices and late-return fines (payable in smiles, allegedly). 

While critics are already predicting chaos during rush hour – imagine arguing about returning *Fifty Shades of Grey* at peak traffic – the NMMC remains optimistic. "We're building a reading culture, one bus route at a time," said an NMMC spokesperson. Next up: poetry slams at signal stops? One can only hope. Now, if only they could fix the potholes on the Palm Beach Road with the same enthusiasm.
