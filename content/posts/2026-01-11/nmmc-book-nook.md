> **TLDR**: NMMC launches mini-libraries at bus stops. Finally, something to do while your bus is late.

Tired of staring at traffic while waiting for the 525 LTD? The NMMC has a solution: books! They're installing mini-libraries at bus stops across the city. Finally, some good news for commuters.

Imagine this: You're at the Nerul bus depot, late for work (again). Instead of doom-scrolling, you grab a book. Not just any book – maybe a thriller set in Sector 17 or a biography of that famous guy from Vashi. It's a far cry from the usual. 

The first "Book Nook" popped up near the APMC market in Vashi. The NMMC plans to roll out these reading spots to other major bus stops, hopefully before the monsoon hits. Think of it as a chance to escape the daily grind, one page at a time. Just remember to bring it back, okay?
