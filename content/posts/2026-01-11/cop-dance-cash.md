> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai police officer is suspended after a video surfaces of him showering cash on bar dancers. Seriously, taxpayers paid for this.

Navi Mumbai's finest just got a little less fine. A video circulating online shows a uniformed police officer, identified as attached to the Local Arms Division, emptying his pockets on dancers at an unnamed bar.

The video, grainy but damning, allegedly shows the officer showering ₹500 notes on the performers. The incident reportedly took place in the jurisdiction of the Turbhe MIDC police station, though details remain hazy.

Following the video's virality, Police Commissioner (what's-his-name) swiftly suspended the officer pending an internal inquiry. No word yet on whether the bar owners will also face consequences. But lets be real, probably not.

This isn't the NMMC's finest hour. Is this what our taxes pay for? Or is this the kind of Friday night we can expect from the guardians of peace?
