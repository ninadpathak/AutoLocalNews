> **TLDR**: All-party meeting today will decide on future protests over the naming of Navi Mumbai Airport. Prepare for more traffic jams and shouting matches, folks.

The naming drama at Navi Mumbai Airport is heading for Act II. An all-party meeting is scheduled today to decide whether to ramp up protests over the airport's proposed name: D. B. Patil International Airport.

For those just tuning in, the state government wants to name it after Balasaheb Thackeray. Local groups are having none of it. They want it named for PWP leader D.B. Patil, the farmers' champion.

Previous protests snarled traffic from Panvel to Kharghar, resulting in some epic commute fails. Expect more of the same if today's meeting greenlights further action. One thing's for sure: Navi Mumbai's residents are gearing up for another round in this very public tug-of-war. This isn't over yet.

The meeting, set for 11 AM at the Agri Koli Sanskruti Bhavan in Belapur, includes representatives from all political parties and action committee members. Sources say a decision on the next course of action is likely by late afternoon. Get ready for announcements.
