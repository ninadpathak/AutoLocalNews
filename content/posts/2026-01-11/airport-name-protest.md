> **TLDR**: All-party meeting today decides on future protests over the naming of Navi Mumbai Airport. Expect more drama than an Ekta Kapoor serial.

The naming saga of Navi Mumbai International Airport continues, folks. Today's the day political parties huddle to decide whether to unleash more protests. All thanks to the ongoing disagreement over whether it should be named after D.B. Patil.

Remember those massive human chains and shutdown threats a while back? Yeah, those might be back on the menu. The सर्वपक्षीय कृति समिति (all-party action committee) is meeting to chart their next move. Word is, they're not thrilled with the state government's current stance.

The meeting is scheduled for this afternoon in Panvel. Expect a flurry of press releases and maybe even some shouting matches. Will they double down on the D.B. Patil demand, or is there room for compromise?

One thing's for sure: this airport naming business is far from over. It's become a political football, and commuters are stuck watching from the sidelines. Get ready for round who-knows-what.
