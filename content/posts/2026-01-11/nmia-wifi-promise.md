> **TLDR**: NMIA is planning a robust digital network for the new airport. Finally, maybe we'll get decent signal out there. 

Remember trying to hail an Ola from the current airport? A digital black hole. NMIA promises a different experience when it (finally) opens in, uh, whenever. The Adani Group (who run the show) is "putting in place a strategy" for seamless digital access, according to ET Telecom. 

What does that *actually* mean? They're planning for a network that can handle a tsunami of devices. Think super-fast Wi-Fi (finally!), reliable mobile data across the 1160-hectare site, and crystal-clear communication for airport staff (so maybe they'll know where your luggage *actually* is).

Expect serious bandwidth. NMIA is aiming for a network that can handle everything from mobile check-in to streaming movies while you wait (and wait, and wait) for your delayed flight. Will it actually work? We'll believe it when we see it. But hey, at least they're talking about it. Maybe Sector 12 is about to get a little more connected.
