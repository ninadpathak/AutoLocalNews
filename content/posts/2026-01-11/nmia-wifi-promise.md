> **TLDR**: NMIA is planning seamless digital connectivity at the new airport. Hopefully, this means you can finally upload that travel selfie without buffering.

Goodbye, dreaded dead zones. The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) promises glitch-free digital access, according to ET Telecom. No more struggling to book a cab the second you land.

NMIA bigwigs are allegedly "putting in place" a strategy. Translation? They’re thinking about Wi-Fi. But this isn't just about basic connectivity. They want seamless transitions between networks, meaning your Zoom call won’t drop as you sprint to baggage claim.

The goal is crystal clear. A connected airport for a connected city. Now, if only they could fix the potholes on the way there. Sector 22 still feels like off-roading.

Will NMIA deliver? Or will it be another grand promise lost in the dust? We’re watching, phone in hand, ready to test the signal strength.
