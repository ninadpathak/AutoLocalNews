> **TLDR**: A Morbe Dam pipeline leak triggered a city-wide water cut. Expect normal supply... eventually, around January 10th. Someone get the NMMC a wrench.

Taps ran dry across Navi Mumbai this week after a major leak hit the Morbe Dam pipeline. The disruption, which started yesterday, left residents scrambling for water tankers and cursing their showers.

The NMMC scrambled to respond, but restoring full supply will take until January 10th. Seems like someone forgot to winterize the plumbing again.

The leak itself occurred near the dam, impacting the entire water supply network that serves sectors across the node. Areas like Nerul, Vashi, and Airoli are facing reduced pressure or complete outages.

While the NMMC promises to deploy tankers to affected areas, residents are advised to store water and prepare for parched days ahead. Maybe invest in a good water filter? Because, you know, January 10th is just a *suggestion*.

This isn't the first time Navi Mumbai's water supply has been disrupted, raising questions about the aging infrastructure and the NMMC's proactive maintenance. Are we surprised? Nope. Thirsty? Yup.
