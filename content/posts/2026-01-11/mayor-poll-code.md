> **TLDR**: Maharashtra SEC investigates mayor for promising development based on religion. Political storms are brewing, and election officers are ready for the fallout.

Did Navi Mumbai just enter a time machine? A newly elected mayor seems to think promising ward development based on religion is A-OK. Maharashtra State Election Commissioner Dinesh Waghmare isn't amused.

The mayor's statement, made at a recent public gathering in Panvel, sparked immediate outrage. Waghmare has promised full protection for any election officials facing political heat. Looks like someone forgot the rule book. The SEC has promised consequences, and the political climate is heating up faster than a Tandoor oven in Sector 17.

"We're ready for any backlash," said an unnamed NMMC official. "We've seen worse". The question is: will this be a slap on the wrist or a full-blown political earthquake? Either way, hold on to your hats, folks. This just got interesting.
