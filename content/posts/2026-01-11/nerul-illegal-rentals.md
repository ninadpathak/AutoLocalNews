> **TLDR**: Four Nerul landlords are in trouble for renting to eight Nigerians without proper checks. Expect fines and maybe worse.

Nerul's rental market just got interesting. Four landlords in Sector 21 are facing the music after allegedly renting their flats to eight Nigerian nationals without following the rules. Whoops.

The cops say the landlords didn't bother verifying the tenants' documents, violating established procedure. This isn't a minor paperwork issue; it's a Section 188 kinda situation (disobeying a public servant). Translation: fines are coming.

An FIR is filed at the Nerul police station, naming the landlords. This whole thing highlights the constant pressure on landlords to do their homework. Renting a flat isn't just about the deposit and monthly ₹₹ anymore. Compliance is key, folks. Next time, do a better job.
