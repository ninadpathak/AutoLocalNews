> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai police officer is missing after a letter accusing a senior of corruption surfaced. Someone's career is about to end VERY badly.

The Navi Mumbai police force has a mystery on its hands. Inspector Abhay Kurundkar of the NRI Coastal police station vanished this week, leaving behind a letter alleging widespread corruption within the department.

Kurundkar's wife filed a missing person complaint after he failed to return home. The letter, purportedly written by Kurundkar, names a senior officer, accusing them of demanding kickbacks from local businesses operating near the coast in the Belapur and Vashi areas.

"This isn't just a missing person case anymore," said a source inside the Sector 15 police station. "If that letter checks out, we're looking at a major internal investigation."

The letter details specific instances, including alleged extortion from seafood vendors near the APMC market and illegal construction permits facilitated near the creek. The accusations are detailed, citing ₹ figures and dates. Looks like someone kept receipts.

NMMC officials are understandably quiet. The investigation is ongoing. But one thing's for sure: the next few weeks at police HQ are going to be spicy.
