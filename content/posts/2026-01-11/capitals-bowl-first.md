> **TLDR**: Delhi Capitals won the toss and chose to bowl against Mumbai Indians. Good news for Capitals fans, maybe bad news for pizza delivery guys expecting late-night orders from MI supporters.

The coin landed in Delhi's favor. They're sending Mumbai in to bat first at the Wankhede. Rishabh Pant seems confident. Rohit Sharma probably isn't thrilled.

Why bowl first? Pant cited "dew factor" and a desire to chase. Translation: Mumbai's bowlers have been leaky as the NMMC's monsoon drainage system, and Delhi wants to exploit that under the lights. Expect Bumrah to be fired up.

Mumbai's lineup remains unchanged. They are sticking with what they know. Will Suryakumar Yadav finally find his form after that duck last week? Or will he be another disappointment?

All eyes are on the powerplay. Can Mumbai's openers set a blistering pace? Or will Delhi's bowlers stifle them early? ₹100 says someone smashes a six over the sightscreen in the first six overs. Place your bets.

The stage is set for another high-octane IPL showdown. Let's see if Delhi's decision pays off, or if Mumbai makes them regret it. Either way, expect fireworks... and probably another strategic timeout every five overs.
