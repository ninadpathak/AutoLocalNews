> **TLDR**: Fewer flamingos spotted this season in Navi Mumbai's wetlands. Conspiracy? Probably just bad luck, but we're watching.

The usual riot of pink is... less riotous. Concerned bird nerds are reporting significantly lower flamingo numbers in the Panje, TS Chanakya, and DPS wetlands this season. Usually, these spots are choked with the long-legged birds by December.

Is this the apocalypse? Probably not. Experts (actual ones, not us) suggest a mix of factors. Late monsoon rains might have messed with their breeding cycle. Or maybe they found a better buffet somewhere else. Who knows what goes on in a flamingo's brain?

What we *do* know is that the wetlands are under constant threat from development. Every reclaimed hectare chips away at their habitat. If the flamingos don't have a safe place to land, they won't. End of story.

The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is conducting surveys to get a better handle on the situation. Hopefully, they will figure out what’s happening. Until then, keep an eye on the skies and count those pink birds. And maybe yell at CIDCO to leave the wetlands alone.
