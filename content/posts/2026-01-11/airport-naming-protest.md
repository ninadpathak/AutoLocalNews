> **TLDR**: The Navi Mumbai airport naming saga continues. Protest leaders meet today to decide if more chaos is on the horizon.

The fight over who gets their name plastered on the Navi Mumbai International Airport isn't over. Leaders of the protests demanding the airport be named after D.B. Patil are meeting today in Panvel to decide their next move. Will they double down on the gridlock, or find a new pressure point?

The last round of protests saw thousands descend on CIDCO Bhavan, leading to traffic nightmares across the city. While the state government has remained tight-lipped, the protesters aren't backing down. They view the naming issue as a matter of pride and legacy. Expect more noise if their demands aren't met.

One thing is clear: This isn't just about an airport; it's about who controls the narrative in Navi Mumbai. Stay tuned for updates; Sector 12 might want to avoid the Panvel highway this afternoon.
