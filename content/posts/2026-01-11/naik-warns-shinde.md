> **TLDR**: Ganesh Naik, NCP heavyweight, tells Shinde to respect Navi Mumbai in upcoming civic polls. Translation: buckle up, this is going to get messy. 

Ganesh Naik, the NCP strongman, has thrown down the gauntlet to Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, warning them not to underestimate his power in Navi Mumbai as the civic polls approach. The former minister made the not-so-subtle threat at a rally in Belapur. Translation: he's ready for a fight.

"Some people think they can take Navi Mumbai lightly," Naik declared. "They need to remember who built this city." (Spoiler: It wasn't them.) He didn't name names, but everyone knew who he was talking about. The Shinde faction and BJP are clearly the targets of his rhetoric.

Naik's message is clear: Navi Mumbai is his turf, and he won't surrender it without a battle. He's reminding Shinde that his grip extends deep into the satellite city, from the APMC market in Vashi to the housing societies of Nerul. He's banking on a mix of old loyalties and new promises to retain control. If Shinde wants a piece of Navi Mumbai, he'll have to earn it.

The question now is whether Shinde will heed Naik's warning or dismiss it as empty bluster. Either way, expect a fierce battle for control of the NMMC. Buckle up, Navi Mumbai. The political temperature is about to rise.
