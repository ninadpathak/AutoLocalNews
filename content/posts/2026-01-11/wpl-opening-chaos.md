> **TLDR**: WPL 2026 kicks off with a concert featuring Honey Singh and other Bollywood glitterati. Because what Navi Mumbai really needs is more noise pollution.

Forget cricket; the real action at the WPL 2026 opening ceremony is the celeb lineup. Honey Singh, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Harnaaz Sandhu are slated to perform at the D.Y. Patil Stadium. Expect ear-splitting bass and questionable dance moves.

Tickets are probably priced higher than your monthly rent in Kharghar. The NMMC better have noise ordinances ready. Sector 5 residents are already bracing for impact. It's going to be louder than peak hour traffic at the Sion-Panvel highway.

Will the performances be good? Irrelevant. Will the traffic be a nightmare? Guaranteed. Maybe they'll rename the stadium 'D.Y. Patil Disco' after this. Don't forget your earplugs.
