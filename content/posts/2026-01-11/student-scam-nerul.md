> **TLDR**: A Nerul student lost ₹2 lakh, including scholarship funds, to a cyber scam. Turns out, even the smartest kids can get played, and these scammers are getting way too good at this.

The dream of paying for college just turned into a digital nightmare for a student from Nerul's Sector 21. They got fleeced for ₹2 lakh in a sophisticated online scam, a chunk of which was hard-earned scholarship money. Irony? We've got bucketloads.

The con started with a seemingly innocent message – because they always do. Posing as a bank representative, the scammer sweet-talked the student into sharing sensitive account details. A few clicks later, the money was gone faster than your patience during a Panvel jam.

Nerul Police Station has registered a case, but let's be real – recovering the money is a long shot. Meanwhile, this serves as a stark reminder: Never, ever share your banking details with anyone, no matter how legit they sound. Not on WhatsApp, not on email, not even if they promise you a free trip to Lonavala.

This isn't just about one student losing money. It's about the increasing sophistication of cybercrime targeting Navi Mumbaikars. The only winning move? Assume everyone online is trying to steal your money. Stay paranoid, stay safe, and maybe just throw your phone into the Arabian Sea. It might be the safest option.
