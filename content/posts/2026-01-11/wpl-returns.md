> **TLDR**: The Women's Premier League is back in Navi Mumbai. Expect traffic and cricket hysteria.

Get ready for dropped catches and traffic jams, folks! The Women's Premier League (WPL) has descended upon our fair city once again. The Mumbai Indians (MI) are gunning for their third title, and DY Patil Stadium is the battleground.

First match is tomorrow, and if last year is anything to go by, expect auto-rickshaws sporting MI flags. Expect kids practicing cover drives in Sector 17 park. Expect the usual 'sports event' chaos. 

Traffic's gonna be a headache, especially around the stadium in Nerul. Plan your routes accordingly, or just embrace the madness. Honestly, might be easier to just watch it on TV.

Will MI snag another trophy? Will the traffic ever clear? Place your bets. Either way, Navi Mumbai is officially in cricket season.
