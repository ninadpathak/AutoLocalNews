> **TLDR**: ₹16.16 lakh in unaccounted cash was found in a Mercedes in Vashi ahead of the NMMC elections. Because nothing says "honest government" like a boot full of ₹500 notes.

Election season's in full swing, and the drama's heating up faster than a Vashi auto stand at noon. This time, it involves a Mercedes, a whole lot of cash, and some very uncomfortable questions for someone.

The Anti-Evasion Squad intercepted the luxury sedan near sector 17, Vashi, earlier today. Inside, they discovered ₹16.16 lakh in unmarked bills. That's a lot of *vada pav* money, even by Navi Mumbai standards.

The cash has been confiscated, and an investigation is underway. The NMMC election is just around the corner; everyone's wondering who this cash belongs to, and what it was meant for. Considering the sheer amount, this wasn't for topping up someone's phone bill. Was it for buying votes? Funding campaigns? Or something more sinister?

One thing's for sure: this discovery will add fuel to the already fiery election debates. Expect accusations, denials, and maybe even a few more surprise "discoveries" before the big day. Stay tuned, folks. This could get interesting.
