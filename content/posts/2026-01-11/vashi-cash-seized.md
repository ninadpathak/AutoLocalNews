> **TLDR**: A flying squad snagged ₹16.16 lakh in unmarked cash from a Vashi car during an election patrol. Someone's having a bad day and might need a new accountant.

The Election Commission's MCC team pulled over a vehicle near Vashi Plaza yesterday. Inside, they found a cool ₹16.16 lakh in undeclared cash. No receipts, no explanations. Just stacks of paper.

The flying squad, bless their suspicious hearts, impounded the moolah immediately. Where was it headed? What was it for? Your guess is as good as ours, but we're betting it wasn't for buying anyone flowers.

This isn't the first time Vashi's seen pre-election funny money. The cops are investigating, and someone's likely sweating bullets right now. Next time, maybe try crypto?
