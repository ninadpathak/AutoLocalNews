> **TLDR**: The High Court stopped the election in a Navi Mumbai ward because a candidate's nomination was wrongly rejected. Classic NMMC election chaos – who didn't see this coming?

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) election in Ward 64 (Turbhe) is on hold, thanks to a High Court intervention. The court found that the Returning Officer (RO) incorrectly applied the law when rejecting a candidate's nomination.

Specifically, the RO invoked a section of the law that simply didn't apply to the candidate in question. Oops.

Now, the State Election Commission (SEC) has been directed to review the matter. Expect delays, legal wrangling, and possibly a fresh round of nominations. For residents of Turbhe, this means continued uncertainty and the distinct possibility that their corporator will be decided by lawyers, not voters. The SEC will announce the next date later, but it's safe to say Ward 64 won't be voting anytime soon.

Remember the last NMMC election? This is somehow worse.
