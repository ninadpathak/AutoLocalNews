> **TLDR**: "Pariksha Pe Charcha" registrations blew past last year's record. Modi fever (or exam stress) is clearly still a thing.

Another year, another registration record shattered for "Pariksha Pe Charcha" (PPC) – clocking in at a bonkers 4.3 crore! Last year's 3.53 crore, which earned a Guinness World Record, now looks like chillar change.

Apparently, everyone wants a piece of Modi's exam advice. Registrations closed January 29th. Students, teachers, and parents from every corner of India signed up.

Is it the promise of stress-busting tips? The chance to snag a selfie with the PM? Or maybe just the national obsession with exams reaching peak levels? Whatever the reason, PPC 2026 is set to be massive.

Maybe they should hold it at the DY Patil Stadium next year. Just a thought.
