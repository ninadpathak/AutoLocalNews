> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai police officer is missing after a letter surfaced accusing his superior of corruption; the wife has filed a complaint. Sounds like someone watched too much 'Gangs of Wasseypur'.

It's getting spicy in the Navi Mumbai police force. A police constable from the NRI Coastal police station is MIA, and things are getting weirder by the minute. 

The constable's wife filed a missing person report after he didn't return home. Then, a letter appeared, allegedly written by the missing officer, accusing a senior inspector of major corruption.

The letter is now circulating faster than gossip at a Kharghar kitty party. The NMMC is supposedly involved somehow. An internal investigation is already underway, or so "sources" *don't* say.

Right now, there's no confirmation the letter is legit. The police are searching for the missing constable to get his side of the story. If this turns out to be true, heads will roll faster than you can say "encounter specialist."
