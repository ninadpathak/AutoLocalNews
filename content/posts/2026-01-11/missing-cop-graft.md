> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai police officer is missing after a letter surfaced accusing a superior of corruption. This smells like a bad Bollywood script, but it's real life in khaki.

The Navi Mumbai police force has a mystery on its hands. Inspector Abhay Kurundkar is MIA, and things are getting spicy fast. A letter, purportedly penned by Kurundkar himself, alleges rampant corruption within the ranks, directly implicating a senior officer. The letter—leaked, naturally—details specific instances of alleged bribery and extortion.

Kurundkar's wife has already filed a missing person report. She claims he left for work as usual but never arrived at the Nerul police station. The timing of his disappearance, coupled with the explosive allegations in the letter, has investigators scrambling.

The big question: Is this a genuine cry for help from a whistleblower, or something more sinister? Either way, the NMMC area just got a whole lot more interesting. Expect the fallout to hit Kharghar and Belapur next week.
