Navi Mumbai's commuters can now bury themselves in a book instead of their phones. The NMMC launched a unique initiative this week: free mini-libraries at key bus stops. The goal? To turn transit time into reading time.

The pilot project kicked off at the Vashi Sector 17 bus depot. Commuters can borrow books without any formal membership. The collection includes a mix of genres, from thrillers to biographies. The NMMC plans to expand the program to other nodes based on its initial success.

The initiative aims to foster a reading culture amidst the city's fast-paced life. Imagine swapping Candy Crush for Camus while waiting for the 520 LTD. For a city obsessed with efficiency, this could be the ultimate productivity hack.
