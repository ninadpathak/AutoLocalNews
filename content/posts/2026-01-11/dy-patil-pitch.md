> **TLDR**: WPL returns to DY Patil Stadium. Expect a batter-friendly pitch, but pace bowlers might enjoy some bounce.

Another day, another chance to witness some sixes. The Women's Premier League returns to the DY Patil Stadium. Forget slow, turning tracks. Word on the street (and from Business Standard) is that this pitch is ready for some serious hitting.

Batters, sharpen those blades! The pitch at DY Patil typically offers a good bounce and carries. This means the ball should come onto the bat nicely, setting the stage for some aggressive strokeplay. Openers, in particular, should look to cash in during the powerplay.

But hold on, it's not *all* bad news for the bowlers. The quicks, if they bend their backs, can extract some extra zip off the surface. Think Jhulan Goswami vibes, not gentle medium pace. Any bowler hitting 120+ KPH will be licking their chops.

The stadium itself? If you haven't been, it's a concrete behemoth near Nerul. Views are decent from most stands, but bring sunscreen. The sun is as brutal as a Harmanpreet Kaur cover drive.

So, Mumbai Indians vs. Delhi Capitals? Place your bets. The smart money is on runs, but don't count out a fiery spell from a sharp seamer.
