> **TLDR**: Water taxis might finally connect Mumbai to NMIA. Because sitting in traffic is *so* last year.

Getting to the new Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) might actually become...pleasant? The Maharashtra Maritime Board is dusting off plans for waterway connectivity from various Mumbai suburbs. Think of it as dodging potholes by boat.

Currently, you're looking at a crawl through Panvel or a long detour via the Mumbai Trans Harbour Sea Link. The proposed water taxi routes could slash travel time significantly. Imagine swapping that two-hour road trip for a breezy ferry ride across the harbor. Sector who?

The routes being considered include Belapur to Ferry Wharf (Bhaucha Dhakka), Vashi to Mandwa, and Nerul to Karanjade. The big win? Direct access to NMIA from locations across Mumbai. No more reliance on the perpetually jammed Sion-Panvel highway.

The project is still in the planning stages, of course. So, don't sell your car just yet. But the promise of a traffic-free commute is enough to get Navi Mumbaikars dreaming of calmer seas and (slightly) less stressful travel.
