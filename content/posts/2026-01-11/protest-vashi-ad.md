> **TLDR**: Ad sparks outrage in Vashi. Pro-Hindu group claims it's offensive and stages a protest outside the store. Prepare for traffic snarls.

Expect some chaos in Sector 17 this afternoon. A pro-Hindu group is staging a protest outside a clothing brand showroom. They say the ad is offensive to their religious sentiments. The vibe outside is tense, with slogans and chants echoing through the area. 

The specific objection? The group isn't saying exactly what they found objectionable about the advertisement. But they are certain enough to gather outside the store and raise hell. Police presence is beefed up, but expect gridlock. This isn't the first time a billboard in Navi Mumbai has stirred up controversy. Remember the whole Panvel renaming fiasco?

CIDCO better keep an eye on this. Any disruption to business hurts Navi Mumbai's growth. Hopefully, this blows over before it messes up weekend plans.
