> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) wants telecom charges mirroring Mumbai's airport. Is this about passenger convenience or just another revenue grab?

NMIA's demanding the same telecom fees as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). They claim it's about providing a consistent passenger experience. Is it really, though?

According to Business Standard, this request is currently under consideration. Translation: expect higher mobile bills at the new airport. They swear that the current telecom infrastructure at NMIA in sectors 113, 114 and 115 is adequate, but need the charges in line with Mumbai to continue operations. Sure, Jan.

It's hard to ignore the feeling that this is less about seamless connectivity and more about squeezing every last rupee out of travelers. After all, aren't we already paying enough for the privilege of flying?
