> **TLDR**: The BJP promised to freeze Navi Mumbai water and property taxes for 20 years if elected. Cynics are wondering how NMMC will afford that.

The BJP just dropped a tax bomb promise on Navi Mumbai. They're pledging a 20-year freeze on water and property taxes if they win the upcoming NMMC elections. Imagine zero tax hikes until 2044.

The announcement is aimed squarely at middle-class voters in nodes like Vashi, Nerul, and Kharghar. But how will the NMMC fund basic services if revenue is flatlined for two decades? It's a question nobody seems to have an answer for. Expect opposition parties to hammer this point home.

Currently, NMMC's revenue from property tax alone is around ₹800 crore annually. Water tax contributes another significant chunk. A freeze means foregoing potential revenue increases from development projects in areas like Dronagiri and Taloja.

The BJP's gamble could be a masterstroke or a fiscal disaster. Either way, Navi Mumbai residents are about to hear a LOT about taxes.
