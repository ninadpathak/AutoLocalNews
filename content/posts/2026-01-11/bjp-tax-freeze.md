> **TLDR**: The BJP pledged to freeze Navi Mumbai water and property taxes for two decades. Sounds great... if you believe them.

Election season is officially here, and the promises are flying faster than the Vashi bridge traffic. The BJP just announced they'll freeze water and property taxes in Navi Mumbai for the next 20 years. Think of all the vada pav you could buy with that extra cash.

This isn't just some vague promise, mind you. They're talking about freezing taxes at current levels. No increases, no sneaky surcharges, nada. This applies to both water bills and property tax assessments across all NMMC wards.

Is this even realistic? Your guess is as good as ours. But with elections around the corner, expect every party to start throwing around promises like confetti at the Ganpati Visarjan. Take it all with a pinch of salt (and maybe invest in some extra vada pav).

Forget 'sources say'. We're saying: believe it when you see it. And maybe check your water meter. Just in case.
