> **TLDR**: NMMC shut down 19 construction sites for spewing dust. 42 more sites got warning notices. Dust chokes, NMMC pokes.

Navi Mumbai's air quality continues its descent into cough-inducing territory, and the NMMC is finally doing something about it. Nineteen construction sites across the city were ordered to cease operations this week after failing to control dust pollution.

Another 42 sites received warning notices, putting them on notice to clean up their act or face the same fate. The crackdown follows weeks of complaints from residents about the never-ending construction dust coating everything they own.

Areas near Kharghar's Central Park and the concrete jungle of Nerul Sector 21 seem to be the worst hit. The NMMC's environment department (yes, they have one) is now promising increased inspections and hefty fines for repeat offenders. Whether this will be a real game changer, or just another bureaucratic gesture is yet to be seen. But we are hopeful.

Meanwhile, residents are advised to wear masks, avoid outdoor activities during peak dust hours, and pray for rain. Basically, another day in Navi Mumbai.
