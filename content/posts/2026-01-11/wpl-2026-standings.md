> **TLDR**: MI leads the WPL 2026 standings as of Jan 11th. Can they keep the crown, or will RCB finally make a push?.

The Women's Premier League 2026 season is heating up, and as of January 11th, the Mumbai Indians are still clinging to the top spot. But don't get too comfortable, folks. 

RCB is breathing down their necks, followed by DC, UPW, and GGT. The standings are tighter than the traffic on the Sion-Panvel highway during peak hours.

Will MI maintain their lead, or will we see a shakeup in the coming weeks? Can RCB finally live up to the hype? The drama is thicker than the smog in Turbhe during Diwali. Get your popcorn ready.

Each team is battling for a coveted playoff spot. With every match comes closer, the pressure rises like the tides at Belapur Jetty.

Keep an eye on those net run rates, folks. It could be the difference between hoisting the trophy and heading home early. Place your bets!
