> **TLDR**: A pipeline burst from the Morbe Dam has cut off water to parts of Navi Mumbai. Guess we're back to bucket showers, folks.

Another day, another infrastructure SNAFU. This time, a major pipeline feeding Navi Mumbai from the Morbe Dam sprung a leak, leaving residents high and dry. The NMMC water department confirmed the rupture occurred early this morning. Sector 5 in Nerul is looking particularly parched.

Areas affected include Vashi, Nerul, and CBD Belapur. Taps are expected to remain dry until repairs are completed. An NMMC spokesperson estimated work will continue for at least 24 hours. So, stock up on bottled water, or embrace that natural musk.

This isn't the first time the Morbe Dam pipeline has thrown a wrench into Navi Mumbai's water supply. Remember last July's fiasco? Maybe it's time to invest in some serious pipeline maintenance. Or maybe we should just move closer to the Arabian Sea. Stay thirsty, Navi Mumbai.
