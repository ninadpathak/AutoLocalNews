> **TLDR**: A pervert made a fake Instagram profile to post obscene content of a teenager. Turns out, some people are still the worst, even in Navi Mumbai.

The cyber cell nabbed a 21-year-old from Ghansoli for creating a fake Instagram account and uploading obscene content of a minor. Apparently, people still do this kind of garbage. The guy's been remanded to police custody until the 27th. Good.

The victim, a 17-year-old from Airoli, noticed the fake profile and notified the cops. Imagine seeing that about yourself? Shudder.

The accused, identified as Shubham Jadhav, was tracked down through his IP address. The cops are still "delving" (ugh, sorry, force of habit) into the details of the case, but it seems pretty open-and-shut: creep makes fake account, creep posts nasty stuff, creep gets caught. Justice? Let's hope so. 

The case is registered under Section 354D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the IT Act. Maybe this will teach other creeps a lesson: don't be a loser. And Navi Mumbai Police, good job getting this dirtbag off the streets.
