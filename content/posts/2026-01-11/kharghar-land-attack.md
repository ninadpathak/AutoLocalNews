> **TLDR**: An HC clerk was attacked during a land possession in Kharghar. This is what happens when Navi Mumbai property disputes get *real* personal.

Chaos erupted in Kharghar's Sector 35 when a land possession process turned ugly. A High Court clerk, tasked with overseeing the transfer, found himself on the receiving end of a father-son beatdown, according to the First Information Report.

The incident occurred during the execution of a court order related to a property dispute. While attempting to facilitate the land transfer, the clerk was allegedly assaulted and threatened by the involved parties. The accused, identified as a father-son duo, are now facing charges under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

Details remain scarce, but sources suggest the dispute involves a long-standing disagreement over property ownership in the rapidly developing node. The Kharghar police are investigating, promising a transparent inquiry. One thing's for sure: securing property in Navi Mumbai remains a contact sport.
