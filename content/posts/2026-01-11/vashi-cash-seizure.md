> **TLDR**: ₹16.16 Lakh in unmarked bills were pulled from a Mercedes in Vashi. Election season is here, and suddenly everyone is getting frisked.

The NMMC's election watchdogs had a busy lunch hour yesterday. At 12:35 PM, a Mercedes-Benz cruising through Vashi got the tap on the window. Turns out, it wasn't carrying groceries.

Instead, officials found ₹16.16 Lakh stashed inside. No immediate explanation was offered. No arrests made, yet. Just a very awkward roadside chat and a growing pile of paperwork.

With elections looming, Navi Mumbai is under a microscope. The NMMC has unleashed 27 surveillance squads across the city. Their mission? Sniff out any shady pre-election shenanigans. Expect more roadblocks, more searches, and maybe even a few more surprise windfalls for the election commission.

Frankly, it's about time they looked this closely at the city's finances. Maybe they'll find where all the missing footpath pavers went.
