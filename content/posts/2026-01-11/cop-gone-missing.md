A police constable from Navi Mumbai has gone missing, sparking a probe into alleged corruption within the force. A letter, purportedly written by the missing officer, implicates a senior inspector in illicit activities. The constable's wife has filed a formal complaint, prompting an immediate inquiry. 

The missing constable, identified as Sachin Mane, was last seen near the Belapur CBD station. The letter, now in the hands of investigators, details alleged extortion rackets and protection money schemes. The Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner has assigned a special team to locate Mane and verify the letter's authenticity. 

The accusations raise serious questions about transparency within the NMMC's law enforcement. Opposition leaders have already seized on the incident, demanding a swift and impartial investigation. For now, the focus remains on locating the missing constable and uncovering the truth behind the allegations.
