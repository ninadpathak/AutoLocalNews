> **TLDR**: A Navi Mumbai policeman is suspended after a video surfaced of him showering cash on bar dancers. Looks like someone forgot the body cam was recording.

The Khaki force has a new embarrassment. A video showing a Navi Mumbai police officer throwing money at bar dancers went viral, resulting in his immediate suspension. The video, reportedly filmed at a bar in Belapur, shows the officer in civilian clothes, apparently enjoying the performance a little *too* much.

The cop is identified as a constable from the local traffic division in sector 11 of CBD Belapur. NMMC corporator Kishore Patkar flagged the video. The Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner, Milind Bharambe, saw the footage and ordered the suspension.

"An inquiry has been initiated," said an NMMC spokesperson. The investigation will look into the circumstances surrounding the video and whether any rules were violated. This isn't the PR the Navi Mumbai police needs, especially given ongoing efforts to improve their image. One thing is for sure, though: someone's getting transferred.
