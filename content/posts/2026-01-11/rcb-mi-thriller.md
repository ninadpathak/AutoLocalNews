> **TLDR**: RCB beat MI on the last ball after some De Klerk heroics. The real crime? Jasprit Bumrah only bowling three overs. 

Forget sleep, Sector 14 residents. Last night’s Mumbai Indians versus Bangalore clash was a nail-biter, ending with RCB snatching victory from the jaws of defeat – or, more accurately, from the butterfingers of the MI fielders. 

MI posted a mammoth 199, thanks to SKY (Surya Kumar Yadav) exploding for 61 off 31 balls. But the real head-scratcher? Jasprit Bumrah, arguably the best bowler *in the world*, only bowled three overs. What was Hardik Pandya thinking? 

Enter De Klerk. The South African all-rounder smashed a blistering 20 off the last over, securing a win that seemed improbable just minutes before. The Wankhede crowd was stunned. Even the seagulls looked shocked.

 But, let's be real, MI lost this one themselves. Dropped catches, questionable bowling changes, and a general air of chaos in the field handed the win to RCB on a silver platter. Maybe Hardik should spend less time posing for Instagram and more time strategizing at the MCA grounds?
