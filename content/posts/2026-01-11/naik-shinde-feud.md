> **TLDR**: Ganesh Naik, NCP heavyweight, just told Deputy CM Shinde not to mess with him regarding the upcoming NMMC elections. Basically, election season in Navi Mumbai is officially spicy.

NCP strongman Ganesh Naik has thrown down the gauntlet to Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, warning him not to underestimate his influence in the upcoming Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) elections. The declaration came at a party meeting in Belapur, where Naik asserted his continued dominance over the satellite city’s political landscape.

"Some people seem to think I've become weak," Naik declared, adding, "They should think again.” He specifically called out Fadnavis, suggesting the BJP was miscalculating Naik’s enduring power base. This isn't just political posturing; it's a direct challenge.

The NMMC elections have been delayed for over two years, and all parties are now gearing up for a fierce battle. Naik’s warning shot signals the NCP's intent to retain control over the civic body. Expect fireworks.

Naik’s message is clear: he and the NCP are ready to fight for every seat in the NMMC. Whether Fadnavis takes the threat seriously remains to be seen. One thing's for sure: the backroom deals and strategic alliances are only just beginning.
