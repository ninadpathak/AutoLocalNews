> **TLDR**: Ganesh Naik fired shots at Eknath Shinde, warning him not to take him lightly in the upcoming NMMC elections. Is this just political posturing, or are the cracks in the ruling coalition starting to show?

Ganesh Naik, NCP heavyweight and former minister, issued a pointed warning to Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde regarding the upcoming Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) polls. Speaking at a party event in Belapur, Naik stated that Shinde shouldn't underestimate his political strength in the region.

Naik's broadside comes as political temperatures rise ahead of the delayed NMMC elections. The BJP-Shinde Sena alliance is looking to wrest control of the corporation from the NCP. Naik's message is clear: he's not giving up without a fight.

The veteran leader highlighted his past successes in Navi Mumbai, reminding Shinde of the challenges he poses. He referenced his continued influence in areas like Airoli and Ghansoli, framing this election as a test of Shinde's reach.

The subtext? This could be more than just pre-election rhetoric. Some speculate that Naik is signaling potential vulnerabilities within the ruling alliance, sensing an opportunity to exploit any fractures. The NMMC battle could become a flashpoint. Keep an eye on the wards of Belapur.
