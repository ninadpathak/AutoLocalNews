> **TLDR**: Ganesh Naik issued a veiled threat to Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis regarding the upcoming NMMC elections. Consider this Navi Mumbai's political temperature rising faster than mercury in Nerul on a summer afternoon.

Ganesh Naik, NCP heavyweight and perpetual thorn in the side of the establishment, has thrown down the gauntlet ahead of the NMMC elections. At a rally in Belapur, Naik took aim at Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, cautioning him not to underestimate his influence in the city. The specific words? Vague. The implication? Crystal clear.

Naik's message, delivered with the subtlety of a pile driver, arrives as political maneuvering intensifies. ThePrint reports Naik referenced past alliances and betrayals, hinting that Fadnavis should remember the past before making future moves in Navi Mumbai's political landscape. Think chess, but with more backstabbing and less decorum.

This isn't just about the NMMC. It's about control of the satellite city, its lucrative development projects, and the prestige that comes with governing a municipality flush with cash. The NMMC polls are expected to be a cage fight, and Naik is clearly signaling he intends to be the last man standing. Expect fireworks near the CIDCO Bhavan in the coming weeks. This could get messy.
