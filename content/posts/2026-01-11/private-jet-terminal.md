> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai Airport will have a special terminal just for private jets. Because regular people flying Vistara are peasants, apparently.

So, you’re telling us the Adani Group is building a whole separate terminal at Navi Mumbai International Airport? Yep. Dedicated *exclusively* to private jets. Forget waiting in line with the rest of us plebs.

This isn't some corner of the existing terminal, mind you. We're talking a purpose-built facility. Think less crowded security lines, more champagne wishes. This is where folks who drop ₹5 Lakh on a whim for a quick jaunt to Goa can avoid *eye contact* with the hoi polloi.

While the rest of us are battling for overhead bin space and praying our SpiceJet flight isn't delayed (again), the 0.1% will be sipping single malt in their plush lounge. The new terminal probably features fancier coffee than your entire building in Kharghar. Bet on it.

Opening date? Still TBD. Bet it will open before the rest of the airport. Naturally.
