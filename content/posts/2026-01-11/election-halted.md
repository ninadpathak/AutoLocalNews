> **TLDR**: High Court stops election in Ward 64 after candidate's nomination was wrongly rejected. Bureaucratic bungling at its finest, folks.

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) election in Ward 64, Sector 2 in Ghansoli, is OFF. The Bombay High Court put the brakes on the poll after ruling that the Returning Officer (RO) screwed up.

Apparently, the RO rejected a candidate's nomination using an act that *didn't even apply* to the poor bloke. The High Court called foul, and now the election is in limbo.

What a mess. Now, Sector 2 residents must wait indefinitely to cast their vote. One has to wonder how many other bureaucratic blunders are hidden within the NMMC. This isn't just about one ward; it's about the entire system. Did someone even bother to read the rulebook before disqualifying a candidate?

So, while candidates cool their heels and voters twiddle their thumbs, the NMMC has some serious explaining to do. Buckle up, folks. This one's going to be a bumpy ride.
