> **TLDR**: Water taxis might soon link Mumbai to the new Navi Mumbai airport. Finally, a way to avoid the Panvel bottleneck.

Forget the pothole-dodging drive to the new airport. The Maharashtra Maritime Board is dusting off plans for a network of water taxis. Imagine skipping the usual chaos and arriving in style. Think less traffic jam, more James Bond.

The plan proposes routes connecting various Mumbai suburbs, like Belapur and Nerul, directly to the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA). This isn't just about the airport, though. The waterways could also link up spots like Vashi, Airoli, and Mandwa. The goal is to decongest our perpetually jammed roads.

Of course, this isn't the first time we've heard about water taxis. But maybe, just maybe, this time it'll actually happen. If it does, expect a serious upgrade to the commute. No more crawling along Sion-Panvel Highway. Instead, picture a breezy cruise across the harbour. Worth it, even if they charge extra for the view.
