> **TLDR**: The transgender community is pushing for higher voter turnout in the upcoming NMMC elections. Will anyone listen, or will Sector 17 keep pretending they don't exist?

Navi Mumbai's transgender community is making a push to get more people to the polls for the upcoming NMMC election. They are urging *everyone* to vote, hoping to make their voices heard.

"Every vote counts," said a representative from the community at a rally near the railway station. "Don't waste your chance to shape Navi Mumbai's future." They highlighted issues like housing, healthcare access, and discrimination, which *still* persist in areas like Vashi and Nerul. Remember that time the cops hassled them near APMC Market? Yeah, *that* kind of thing.

Getting people to actually *show up* is always the hard part. Especially when folks are too busy dealing with potholes the size of craters and dodging illegal hawkers outside Seawoods Grand Central Mall. But maybe, *just maybe*, this election will be different. Maybe Sector 5 Kopar Khairane will surprise us. Maybe people will actually vote for someone who cares. Or maybe not. But you can't complain if you don't vote. So do it. Please.
