> **TLDR**: Navi Mumbai is among 15 Maharashtra cities reserving mayoral posts for women. About time, honestly.

Get ready for a shakeup at NMMC headquarters! The state government just announced that Navi Mumbai, along with Pune, Nagpur, and Nashik, will have a woman mayor. Finally.

This isn't just about "girl power" (eye roll). The reservation applies to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra. The move is part of a larger effort to, you know, actually represent half the population.

Expect some political jockeying as various parties scramble to nominate candidates. Will we see a seasoned corporator step up, or a fresh face ready to challenge the old guard? Either way, the mayoral election is about to get interesting. Maybe even less boring than the endless discussions about potholes on the Thane-Belapur road.

The actual date for the election? Still TBD. But with the announcement made, expect things to move quickly. Keep an eye on the NMMC general body meetings – that's where the real drama unfolds. Forget your daily soaps, this is real life, folks.

Now, if they could only fix the water supply issues in Kharghar...
