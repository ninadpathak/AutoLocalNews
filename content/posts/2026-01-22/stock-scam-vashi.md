> **TLDR**: A retired steel company exec in Navi Mumbai got fleeced for ₹75 lakh in an online stock scam. The stock market: still a great way to lose your money.

Sector 17, Vashi, became the latest ground zero for online financial crime. A former assistant general manager of a steel company got duped out of ₹75 lakh. The con? An online stock market trading scheme, naturally.

The victim, whose name is being withheld because, well, embarrassment, fell for the classic trap. Initial small gains, followed by increasingly large demands for investment. Then, poof! Money gone.

The scam unfolded over a few weeks, with the fraudsters promising huge returns. They lured the victim in with promises that were probably delivered via WhatsApp forward. The money trail led to various shell accounts, probably scattered across the country like loose change.

The Vashi police station has registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC and the IT Act. Chances of recovering the funds? Slim to none, sadly. Consider this your regular reminder: if it sounds too good to be true, especially on the internet, it is. Maybe stick to fixed deposits, folks.
