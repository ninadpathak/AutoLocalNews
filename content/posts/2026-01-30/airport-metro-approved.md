> **TLDR**: The Maharashtra cabinet greenlit the long-awaited metro link connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai airports. Maybe this time it'll actually happen; don't hold your breath.

The ₹12,700 Crore project aims to directly connect the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) to the existing Mumbai airport, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). The Raigad Collectorate is already acquiring land for the Taloja to NMIA section.

This 27-km route, mainly elevated, is planned to run from CSMIA to Mankhurd, then seamlessly extend to NMIA. Think fewer traffic jams and more time for chai. Supposedly.

City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) will execute the NMIA-Taloja section. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will handle the remainder. The goal? Seamless connectivity from one airport to the other. Good luck with that, folks.

Will this actually ease congestion or just become another monument to bureaucratic delays? Only time will tell. But hey, at least they approved it. Again.
