> **TLDR**: Mumbai's building a ₹22,862 crore metro line to speed up airport trips. Finally, a possible escape from Palm Beach Road's parking lot.

The Indian Express says that the new metro line aims to cut travel time to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport from 75 minutes to just 30. Imagine actually making a flight without the usual heart-stopping sprint from Vashi.

This isn't some pipe dream from CIDCO; it's an actual plan with actual money. The line will connect to key Navi Mumbai nodes. Think faster access from Kharghar and Nerul.

Still, we've heard promises before. Remember the Seawood's Grand Central Terminal? Until we're sipping coffee in the departure lounge a full hour early, we're filing this under "cautiously optimistic".

But hey, maybe this time, getting to the airport won't involve selling a kidney to pay for toll and taxi fares. We will believe it when we see it.
