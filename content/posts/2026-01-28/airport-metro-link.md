> **TLDR**: A new 35km metro line will connect Mumbai and Navi Mumbai Airports. Finally, some good news amidst never ending construction.

Finally! A reason to be (cautiously) optimistic. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) is building a 35-km metro line that will directly link both airports. Think fewer rickshaw rides and less Palm Beach Road rage.

The ₹18,000 crore project aims to make travel between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Mumbai) and Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) seamless. Sector numbers are still vague, but expect stations near key nodes in Kharghar and Panvel.

While timelines remain, shall we say, *flexible*, the goal is improved connectivity for the satellite city. Imagine: landing in Mumbai, hopping on the metro, and arriving in Navi Mumbai without battling traffic. It's a beautiful dream.

Of course, this is CIDCO we're talking about. So, don't hold your breath. But hey, at least they're *talking* about fixing things.
