> **TLDR**: BJP snagged 66 seats in the NMMC. Good turnout, everyone's pretending to care about local elections again.

The BJP is back, baby! After a ten-year break, they've bulldozed their way back into control of the NMMC. Looks like विकास (progress) is back on the menu, folks.

They grabbed 66 seats in the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation. Word on the street is that voters actually showed up this time, which is a shocker. Usually, these civic polls are about as exciting as watching paint dry on the Vashi bridge.

What does this mean for us? Expect more potholes filled with saffron paint. More statues of dead guys nobody remembers. And definitely more excuses for why your water bill is higher than your rent. Maybe they'll finally fix that eyesore of a skywalk near the station.

But hey, at least something changed, right? Now we can complain about a whole new set of politicians messing things up. Stay tuned, folks. This should be a fun ride.
