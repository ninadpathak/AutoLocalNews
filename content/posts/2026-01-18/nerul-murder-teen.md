> **TLDR**: An 18-year-old is dead after a fight over a girl in Nerul. The twist? Her little brother is allegedly involved. 

The Sector 21 love triangle took a deadly turn this week. Cops say Nikhil Jadhav, 18, was beaten to death near the old Nerul dumping ground. What started as a teenage squabble ended with a boy gone and five others in custody, including the girl’s younger brother. Seriously, what is going on with these kids?

According to police, Jadhav was dating a Nerul teen. But the relationship went south, and her 16-year-old brother allegedly took matters into his own hands. He and four friends reportedly lured Jadhav to a secluded spot and then beat him senseless.

Jadhav was rushed to DY Patil Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. The cops have booked all five suspects for murder. This isn’t a movie, kids. Real lives are at stake. Now five young lives are on hold. The next time you think about solving things with fists, remember Nikhil. And maybe find a good therapist instead.
