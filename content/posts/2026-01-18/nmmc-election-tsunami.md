> **TLDR**: The opposition just steamrolled the NMMC elections. Expect dramatic changes at the civic HQ in Belapur. 

Belapur's political landscape just got nuked. Early results show a near-total wipeout for the ruling coalition. Sector 15 is buzzing – nobody saw this coming.

Multiple sources are calling it a "referendum on corruption." Remember the ₹80 Crore road resurfacing scam? Voters sure did.

The opposition, riding a wave of anti-incumbency, is projected to take at least 90 of the 111 seats. Their campaign promised transparency, accountability, and an end to "builder raj" in nodes like Kharghar and Panvel.

What does this mean for Navi Mumbai? Expect a shakeup of every department from water supply in Airoli to sanitation contracts in Nerul. The old guard is out. The new era...starts now.
