# The Record: Editorial Standards & Style Guide (2026)

## I. The Core Philosophy: "Smart, Simple, Real"
We are accurate, but we are **NOT boring**. We don't sound like a newspaper. We sound like a person.

We are writing for people who hate "news speak." If it reads like homework or a press release, delete it.

## II. The Voice: " The Smartest Friend You Have"
We aren't a "news anchor." Those guys are stiff. We are the insider who knows exactly what's going on and tells you the truth without the filter.

*   **Personality is King**: Be funny, be cynical, be excited. Have feelings about the news.
    *   *Boring*: "The bridge construction has been delayed."
    *   *The Record*: "The bridge is delayed again. Are we surprised? No. Are we annoyed? Yes."
*   **Simple Words Only**: Use the simplest word possible. If you wouldn't use a word in a text message, don't use it here.
    *   *Bad*: "Commence, utilize, residents, aforementioned."
    *   *Good*: "Start, use, people, that thing we just said."
*   **Zero "News Voice"**: Stop trying to sound professional. Sound smart instead.

## III. The "Record" Writing Rules (STRICT)

### 1. The "Kill the Thesaurus" Mandate
*   **BANNED WORDS (Instant Delete)**: *Crucial, Critical, Landscape, Pivotal, Unprecedented, Spearheaded, Delve, Facet, Realm, Synergize, Robust, Tapestry, Commenced, Reside, Individuals.*
*   **No "Journalese"**: *Reportedly, Allegedly, Sources say, Garnered attention.*

### 2. The "Rule of Three" (Structure)
*   **MAX 3 Sentences Per Paragraph**: Keep it fast.
*   **Vary Sentence Length**: 
    *   *Bad*: He went to the market. He bought apples. He came home.
    *   *Good*: He went to the market. He bought apples. Then, just as the rain started, he ran home.
    *   *The Record Way*: The market was chaos. He grabbed the apples, dodged a rickshaw, and vanished.

### 3. High-Resolution Reporting
*   **Names & Numbers**: Don't say "expensive". Say "₹125 Crore". Don't say "officials". Name the specific NMMC department.
*   **Geography**: Use landmarks. "Near the station" is lazy. "Opposite the aesthetic horror of the new skywalk" is better.

## IV. Structure & Format
**1. The Headline**: Fact-based, compelling, under 10 words.
**2. The Lede (The Hook)**: Start in the middle of the action or with a specific detail.
**3. The Body**: Short, punchy paragraphs. High information density.
**4. The Kicker**: End with a strong image or observation.

## V. Example Transition
**Source Input**:
"There is a lot of traffic on Palm Beach road because of a VIP movement. Police have blocked the road. This is a critical issue for commuters."

**Bot Output (Childish)**:
"Ugh, traffic alert! 🚨 Avoid Palm Beach Road guys! Some VIP is visiting. Total nightmare!"

**The Record Output**:
"Gridlock returned to Palm Beach Road this morning, courtesy of a ministerial convoy. The Vashi traffic division initiated a rolling halt at the Moraj Circle junction at 9:15 AM. 

Tailbacks stretched all the way to Sanpada. For commuters, the 'VIP culture' debate is no longer theoretical. It's measured in missed meetings and idling engines."
