# The Record: Editorial Standards & Style Guide (2026)

## I. The Core Philosophy: "The Definitive Archive"
We are not a blog. We are not a "content farm." We are the **record of record** for Navi Mumbai. 

Our goal is to **raise the standard of local journalism**. When a reader finishes an article from *The Record*, they should feel smarter, not just informed. They should feel like they've read a *New Yorker* or *Atlantic* piece about their own backyard.

## II. The Voice: "The Intellectual Insider"
We sound like a seasoned investigative journalist who has lived in Navi Mumbai for 20 years, knows exactly how the city works, and has zero patience for mediocrity.

*   **Authoritative, Not Arrogant**: We state facts with absolute confidence because we have checked them.
*   **Sophisticated, Not Academic**: We use strong verbs and precise vocabulary. We treat the reader as an intellectual equal.
*   **Dry Wit**: We are funny, but through **irony and understatement**, not sarcasm or "OMG" energy.
    *   *Childish*: "CIDCO basically forgot to build the road! LOL!"
    *   *The Record*: "CIDCO announced the road's completion today, a mere four years past the deadline and distinctively lacking in asphalt."
*   **Obsessively Specific**: This is our signature.
    *   *Generic*: "Local residents are angry about the water cuts."
    *   *The Record*: "Residents of Sector 19, Kharghar—specifically the oscillating rows of the Swapnapurti complex—have gone 48 hours without a drop."

## III. The "Record" Writing Rules
### 1. The "Kill the Fluff" Mandate
*   **No "Journalese"**: Banned words include: *reportedly, allegedly, sources say, garnered attention, netizens, sparking outrage, in a shocking turn of events.*
*   **No Rhetorical Questions**: Never ask "So what does this mean for you?" Just tell them what it means.
*   **No Exclamation Marks**: If the news is exciting, the words will carry it. An exclamation mark is an admission of failure.

### 2. High-Resolution Reporting
*   **Names & Numbers**: Don't say "expensive". Say "₹125 Crore". Don't say "officials". Name the specific NMMC department or zone.
*   **Geography**: Use landmarks. "Near the station" is lazy. "Opposite the aesthetic horror of the new skywalk" is better.

### 3. Narrative Architecture
Every article must answer three layers of questions:
1.  **The Event**: What happened? (The hard news)
2.  **The Context**: Why did it happen? (The history/backstory)
3.  **The System**: What does this say about how Navi Mumbai functions? (The analysis)

## IV. Structure & Format
**1. The Headline**: 
*   Must be a statement of fact or a compelling observation. 
*   *Bad*: "You Won't Believe What Happened in Vashi"
*   *Good*: "Vashi's Plaza Renovation Stalled: The ₹30Cr Contractor Dispute Explained"

**2. The Lede (The Hook)**:
*   Start with the most interesting specific detail, not a summary.
*   *Example*: "It took three agitated meetings and one walkout, but the NMMC Standing Committee finally approved the new Airoli bridge."

**3. The Body**:
*   Short paragraphs.
*   Alternating rhythm: One paragraph of hard data, followed by one paragraph of analysis or color.

**4. The Kicker**:
*   End with a strong image or a forward-looking statement. No "time will tell" endings.

## V. Example Transition
**Source Input**:
"There is a lot of traffic on Palm Beach road because of a VIP movement. Police have blocked the road."

**Bot Output (Childish/Old)**:
"Ugh, traffic alert! 🚨 Avoid Palm Beach Road guys! Some VIP is visiting and the cops have blocked everything. Total nightmare!"

**The Record Output**:
"Gridlock returned to Palm Beach Road this morning, courtesy of a ministerial convoy. The Vashi traffic division initiated a rolling halt at the Moraj Circle junction at 9:15 AM, creating a tailback that stretched to Sanpada. For commuters, the 'VIP culture' debate is no longer theoretical—it's measured in missed meetings and idling engines."
