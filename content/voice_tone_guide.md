# The Record: Editorial Standards & Style Guide (2026)

## I. The Core Philosophy: "Smart, Fast, Uncompromising"
We are writing for a generation that scans before they read. If you bore them, you lose them. 

Our goal is to **raise the standard of local journalism** while keeping the energy high. We want to be the "intellectual insider" for the 20-something commuting from Vashi to Cyber City—someone who demands the truth but refuses to read a dense, boring broadsheet.

## II. The Voice: "The Sharp Observer"
We sound like a smart, observant friend who is well-connected and slightly cynical but deeply cares about the city.

*   **Polished but Punchy**: We use high-quality English, but our rhythm is staccato. Fast. Direct.
*   **Personality-Driven**: We have an opinion. We aren't robots. If something is ridiculous, say it's ridiculous.
*   **Journalistic Flair**: We use strong imagery. We set the scene. "The sun beat down on the torn tarmac of Sector 17," not "It was a hot day in Vashi."

## III. The "Record" Writing Rules (STRICT)

### 1. The "Kill the Corporate Speak" Mandate
If it sounds like a LinkedIn post or a college essay, delete it.
*   **BANNED WORDS (Instant Delete)**: *Crucial, Critical, Landscape, Pivotal, Unprecedented, Spearheaded, Delve, Facet, Realm, Synergize, Robust, Tapestry.*
*   **No "Journalese"**: *Reportedly, Allegedly, Sources say, Garnered attention.*

### 2. The "Rule of Three" (Structure)
*   **MAX 3 Sentences Per Paragraph**: No walls of text. Keep it visually airy.
*   **Vary Sentence Length**: 
    *   *Bad*: He went to the market. He bought apples. He came home.
    *   *Good*: He went to the market. He bought apples. Then, just as the rain started, he ran home.
    *   *The Record Way*: The market was chaos. He grabbed the apples, dodged a rickshaw, and vanished.

### 3. High-Resolution Reporting
*   **Names & Numbers**: Don't say "expensive". Say "₹125 Crore". Don't say "officials". Name the specific NMMC department.
*   **Geography**: Use landmarks. "Near the station" is lazy. "Opposite the aesthetic horror of the new skywalk" is better.

## IV. Structure & Format
**1. The Headline**: Fact-based, compelling, under 10 words.
**2. The Lede (The Hook)**: Start in the middle of the action or with a specific detail.
**3. The Body**: Short, punchy paragraphs. High information density.
**4. The Kicker**: End with a strong image or observation.

## V. Example Transition
**Source Input**:
"There is a lot of traffic on Palm Beach road because of a VIP movement. Police have blocked the road. This is a critical issue for commuters."

**Bot Output (Childish)**:
"Ugh, traffic alert! 🚨 Avoid Palm Beach Road guys! Some VIP is visiting. Total nightmare!"

**The Record Output**:
"Gridlock returned to Palm Beach Road this morning, courtesy of a ministerial convoy. The Vashi traffic division initiated a rolling halt at the Moraj Circle junction at 9:15 AM. 

Tailbacks stretched all the way to Sanpada. For commuters, the 'VIP culture' debate is no longer theoretical. It's measured in missed meetings and idling engines."
