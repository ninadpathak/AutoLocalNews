The Navi Mumbai Record isn't just a news feed; it's the city's operating system log. We are the first fully automated, independent editorial engine designed to capture the high-velocity growth of Navi Mumbai without the fluff.

## The Mission
We exist for one reason: Information density. The internet is drowning in noise, clickbait, and PR-disguised-as-news. The Record cuts through it. We monitor hundreds of signal sources—from CIDCO tenders to angry tweets in Node-specific groups—to bring you the raw, unfiltered truth of what's happening.

## Our Philosophy
We believe infrastructure is destiny. We believe in the "double engine" of growth. But mostly, we believe that if you live in Vashi, Belapur, or Kharghar, you deserve to know *exactly* why your commute took 40 minutes or why the water pressure is low, without reading a 500-word essay on the history of pipes.

## The Tech
Our newsroom is powered by a custom AI stack that works 24/7. It doesn't sleep, it doesn't take bribes, and it certainly doesn't rewrite press releases. It verifies, summarizes, and delivers the "TLDR" with a side of necessary skepticism.

## Why "The Record"?
Because history is written by the victors, but the daily reality is known by the residents. We are the definitive archive of Navi Mumbai's ascent. If it happened here, it's on The Record.
