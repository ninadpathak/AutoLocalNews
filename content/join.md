The Flamingo is an independent experiment that runs on human logic. We need observers who understand the city's grid better than an algorithm.

## The Role
Journalists here don't write fluff. You are the architects of the narrative. You train the models, sharpen the voice, and maintain our high information density. 

## The Requirements
- Granular knowledge of Navi Mumbai's Sectors and politics.
- A total distaste for em-dashes and clichés.
- A punchy, sharp, and modern communication style.

## Get in Touch
Send your portfolio and a note on why Navi Mumbai is the city of the 21st century to join@theflamingo.navi.
