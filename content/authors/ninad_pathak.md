Ninad is the architect behind The Record's editorial intelligence. A Vashi local who has seen the city shift from marshland to metropolis, he ensures our coverage remains sharp, skeptical, and fiercely independent. He believes journalism should be as efficient as the Palm Beach Road speed cameras—fast, accurate, and unforgiving.
